0,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"New data has revealed that complaints of workplace sexual harassment and discrimination continue to be a concern, with over 800 workers seeking help and 1153 seeking the advice and representation services provided by Legal Aid NSW’s Respect at Work Legal Service (RAWLS) since January 2023. Of those services provided by RAWLS, 71% were for female clients, with the most common complaint being disability discrimination (27%), followed by sexual harassment (20%) and sex discrimination (14%).

The figures come amid increased awareness of sexual harassment because of the #MeToo movement and ongoing efforts to address the issue, including the introduction of a “positive duty” on employers to act to prevent sexual harassment and sex discrimination.

RAWLS solicitor Fiona Pace said that while it is positive that people are getting legal help, the fact that women are still experiencing workplace sex-based discrimination and harassment is a cause for concern. Pace added that the service continues to see women experiencing unwelcome sexual behaviours in the workplace, including assaults and inappropriate comments.

“Sex-based discrimination based on pregnancy or family responsibilities are also common issues we see, with some complaining of losing their job on this basis. The harmful impact of these experiences cannot be overstated. We see clients who experience financial loss from being demoted, losing shifts or their job, or being victimised for complaining. People are also dealing with the mental health impacts and stress,” Pace said.

RAWLS, a free state-side legal service offered by Legal Aid NSW, was established in 2023 to support people experiencing workplace sexual harassment and discrimination. It followed the Respect@Work report, which found that a third of workers, and two in five women, have experienced sexual harassment. Pace said that of the advice provided by RAWLS, 6% was related to racial discrimination. “We know racial discrimination is widespread with 16% of Australians experiencing it, so we really encourage more people to seek help,” Pace said.

The highest number of complaints came from the healthcare and social assistance sector, followed by the professional, scientific and technical sector and accommodation and food services. According to Pace, certain groups like newly arrived migrants, farm workers, young people, Aboriginal people and those from CALD communities are more likely to be affected by discrimination and harassment but are less likely to seek help. “We really encourage people to come forward so we can find the right solution for them to help protect their job and resolve things early on before they escalate,” Pace said.

RAWLS works with other organisations to support clients, including with trauma-informed referral pathways to partner organisations that can provide specialist non-legal support. Legal Aid NSW CEO Monique Hitter said ensuring people can understand and defend their rights in the workplace is essential to address workplace discrimination.

“We know from the Respect@Work report that ensuring people have access to free legal help early on is part of addressing the prevalence of workplace discrimination and sexual harassment. RAWLS has achieved great outcomes for clients. Many workplace complaints have been resolved with clients receiving compensation, apologies from employers and changes to policies or training for staff,” Hitter said.

1,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has published a Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace report, highlighting the changing impact of work-related psychological injuries in Australia. The report revealed that during 2021–22, mental health conditions accounted for 9% of all serious workers compensation claims, marking a 36.9% increase since 2017–18. The median time lost was more than four times greater than that of all physical injuries and illnesses (2020–21). The median compensation paid for mental health conditions was more than three times greater than that of all physical injuries and illnesses. The report also found that workers with claims for mental health conditions experienced poorer return to work outcomes and were more likely to experience stigma from colleagues and their employers.

Marie Boland, Chief Executive Officer of Safe Work Australia, said the report aims to increase the understanding of the impact of psychosocial hazards at work by providing insights that can help governments, researchers, industry and worker representatives address current and future challenges in psychological health and safety.

“Proactively managing psychosocial hazards at work not only protects workers, it also benefits businesses by improving organisational performance and productivity. Under model work health and safety laws, psychosocial hazards and risks are treated the same as physical hazards and risks,” Boland said.

The data for the report was drawn from Safe Work Australia’s National Dataset for Compensation-based Statistics, the National Return to Work Survey and the People at Work risk assessment survey. Boland said that the report illustrates the importance of Safe Work Australia’s work to support workplaces to understand and meet their work health and safety duties in relation to psychosocial hazards.

2,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"In the first ‘normal’ year post-COVID, Australians are reportedly feeling less connected, valued and included at work; however, organisations focused on diversity and inclusion are bucking the trend, according to a report released by Diversity Council Australia (DCA). The 2023–2024 Inclusion@Work Index captured the state of inclusion and diversity in post-pandemic Australia, drawing comparisons with previous releases in 2021–2022 (during the pandemic) and 2019–2020 (pre-pandemic).

While discrimination, harassment and other forms of workplace exclusion eased off for many workers during the pandemic, data from the 2023–2024 Index shows these trends reversing in post-pandemic workplaces. The data shows that 19% of Australian workers don’t feel valued, respected or able to contribute and progress at work in 2023, a figure that has nearly doubled since 2019.

More workers also feel their manager does not behave in an inclusive way, with 27% reporting their managers did not value differences, treat everyone fairly or deal with inappropriate behaviour — a 9% increase from 2021 (18%) and up 6% from 2019 (21%). Discrimination and harassment are also on the rise, with 30% of workers experiencing discrimination and/or harassment at work in 2023 — up by 8% from 2021 (22%) and 4% higher than the pre-pandemic figure of 26% in 2019.

The report found that D&I active organisations are bucking this trend. Workers who indicated that their organisation is taking action to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace are twice as likely to belong to an inclusive team and have an inclusive manager, and nearly twice as likely to report their work has a positive effect on their mental health. They are also twice as likely to provide excellent customer service, collaborate effectively, solve problems in an innovative way and work extra hard.

DCA CEO Lisa Annese said that although many behave as though the global pandemic is behind us, Australians are still recovering from the shared trauma of the past few years, with workplaces adjusting to the latest ‘new normal’ and grappling with questions around flexible working, AI technology, inflationary pressures and growing skills shortages.

“Meanwhile, employees are still processing the trauma and disruption of the past few years, fuelling a growing disillusionment with traditional working arrangements. With all this in mind, it is unsurprising that DCA’s 2023–2024 Inclusion@Work Index finds workers feeling less connected, valued and included post-pandemic. In a time of so much disruption and division, a focus on diversity and inclusion is more important than ever. This report addresses the unique problems of the post-pandemic workforce and lays out a case for D&I action as a proven solution,” Annese said.

3,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The NSW Government has proposed tougher penalties for employers responsible for industrial manslaughter, including $18 million in fines and lengthy prison sentences. In 2023, the NSW Government announced that it would introduce an industrial manslaughter offence.

The proposed measures are detailed in a consultation paper as the government invites feedback on how to best introduce the new laws and which elements will make up the offence. Industrial manslaughter laws will allow for a business or individual to be held responsible for the death of a person due to negligent or reckless behaviour in the workplace.

The feedback from the survey will be used to inform the government on key elements to include within the NSW Work Health and Safety Act and other relevant considerations for introducing an industrial manslaughter offence in NSW. The paper, developed by SafeWork NSW, provides an overview of what industrial manslaughter is and outlines the offences and penalties that have been implemented in other Australian jurisdictions. NSW is the last mainland state without an industrial manslaughter offence.

Members of the community, including work health and safety experts, business groups, unions, legal stakeholders and families of people who have been killed at work are all encouraged to provide submissions to the consultation paper.

Minister for Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis said it is important that the views of members of the community, including businesses, industry, representative bodies and workers, are considered before introducing industrial manslaughter laws. “We never want to have to use these laws. Any workplace death is a tragedy and in cases where a person with a duty of care has been careless or irresponsible, they must be held accountable,” Cotsis said.

4,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A new report from Building Commission NSW has made key recommendations to help boost the number of women working in construction across NSW. The Building Commission NSW Women in Construction Report provides recommendations to increase female participation in the industry and address some of the systemic challenges they face in their careers.

The recommendations provide a roadmap to help address the barriers to attracting and retaining women, addressing negative perceptions, raising business and HR knowledge, and improving workplace culture in the construction industry.

With more than 100,000 construction workers needed to meet the demand for housing supply in NSW, the report highlights the issues that must be addressed to meet productivity aims. Small to medium construction businesses reportedly account for 80% of the industry and employ less than 5% of women, while 35% of these businesses employ no women at all.

The report reveals that 71% of women employed in these businesses have experienced discrimination, with one in two women experiencing sexual harassment. Some small business employers are also reluctant to hire women due to fears of being held legally responsible for any inappropriate behaviour by male employees in the workplace.

The report also found that 42% of male employers perceive the physical demands of the work as too high for women, compared to 13% of female employers. More than 1700 people across NSW participated in the research, representing a cross-section of the community including men, women, students and the general public.

5,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) has revealed that new safety legislation to help improve the safety standards for offshore oil and gas workers has been introduced to parliament. The offshore oil and gas sector involves workers undertaking dangerous tasks in remote and isolated areas. The sector presents significant physical and psychological hazards for workers. To address these issues, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Legislation Amendment (Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2024 aims to provide stronger protections for offshore oil and gas workers.

The new safety legislation aims to strengthen the role and training of health and safety representatives (HSRs). It also allows HSRs to request a review of safety management documents. The new legislation also aims to improve worker protection against discrimination and coercion, strengthen the mental health protections for workers, improve health and safety rules for diving operations and dive vessels, and simplify the reporting requirements for serious injury notifications.

The government has also announced that it will carry out a review to identify opportunities to harmonise the offshore petroleum safety regime with national work health and safety laws. ACTU Assistant Secretary Liam O’Brien said he welcomed the federal government’s ongoing commitment to improving work health and safety.

“Health and safety representatives play an important role in keeping workplaces safe. Strengthening their role, along with enhancing the protections against discrimination, is vital if safety is going to improve. We also welcome the government’s ambition to harmonise offshore petroleum safety with our national laws. Workers in Commonwealth waters shouldn’t have less protection than those on land. Every worker has a right to safe and healthy work,” O’Brien said.

6,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The NSW Government has established an Asbestos Taskforce to give more resources and support to the state’s Environment Protection Authority’s (EPA) investigation into the asbestos contamination that was detected in mulch used across various locations in Sydney. The discovery of asbestos contamination earlier this month prompted immediate action from local councils, the EPA and the Department of Education.

Led by Carolyn Walsh, the current Chair of the NSW Asbestos Coordination Committee, the taskforce will also include senior representatives of several NSW Government agencies, as well as local government. The Premier and Minister for the Environment have also activated a surge workforce to assist the EPA, as the scale of the investigation continues to grow. Additional staff from the Natural Resources Access Regulator and NSW Fire and Rescue will also be deployed to the EPA to increase capacity, along with the EPA’s expanded workforce on the investigation.

The taskforce will help coordinate government agencies and help prioritise sites considered to be of highest risk to the public, to ensure all resources are available to secure and remediate sites. It will also support the EPA to ensure the environmental risks to public land are appropriately managed, as the EPA conducts its criminal investigation into any breaches of the law. The NSW Government is also considering regulatory changes to strengthen penalties and deterrence. Minister for the Environment Penny Sharpe said the government’s main priority is to finish contact tracing the supply chain, so that any potential receiver of the mulch is identified — this will enable the taskforce to take immediate action to make the area safe.

“This is the largest investigation the Environment Protection Authority has undertaken in recent decades. The complex, criminal investigation involves multiple lines of enquiry. The surge workforce means we can get to the bottom of the supply chain much faster,” Sharpe said.

Clare Collins, Chair of the Asbestos Education Committee, has urged the public not to panic but to avoid mulched areas until sites have been inspected and cleared of possible asbestos contamination. Collins also encouraged the public to contact their local council immediately if they observe what they suspect to be pieces of bonded asbestos in a public place. “According to reports, the bonded or non-friable asbestos identified in mulch are pieces of broken asbestos-cement sheeting known as fibro, which most likely came from building demolition sites. However, how this occurred on such a significant scale at so many sites, is the real question to be explored,” Collins said.

While there is a lot of community concern and confusion surrounding the discovery of bonded asbestos, the NSW Government has assured the public that it will continue to carry out “contact tracing” down the complex supply chain, then facilitate testing, reporting and management of any positive results. SafeWork NSW, NSW Health and the Public Works Advisory will also provide support.

“There’s a lot of community concern and confusion surrounding these bonded asbestos finds in 23 public locations (to date) because people are unsure of how dangerous non-friable asbestos pieces are, what the materials might look like, what the risks to health are and what to do if they come across it. Fibro debris is usually a light grey or a dirty colour (especially when mixed with soil or leaf matter) — it resembles flat broken cement with the tell-tale golf ball-like dimpling on one side, and will often have jagged edges where it has been broken and may have old paint on the non-dimpled side,” Collins said.

Collins also warned homeowners that asbestos debris could be closer to home than they might think, as it is not uncommon to find fibro debris left over from the original build or renovations at residential properties built before 1990 including brick, weatherboard, fibro or clad homes. It can also be found in garden beds, loose under homes and under concrete paths.

According to the Asbestos Education Committee, fibro was the most common non-friable asbestos-containing building material produced before a complete asbestos ban was enacted in Australia in December 2003. Non-friable asbestos cannot be crumbled, pulverised or reduced to a powder by hand pressure when dry; it is considered low-risk when undisturbed, sealed, wet or damp.

However, while the asbestos identified in mulch in a majority of locations has been determined to be non-friable, Collins said it is “extremely concerning” that friable asbestos was identified in a Surry Hills park frequented by locals. Friable asbestos can be extremely dangerous; it can be crumbled, pulverised or reduced to a powder by hand pressure. If its fibres become airborne and inhaled, it poses significant health risks. Non-friable asbestos can also become friable if damaged, demolished or exposed to the elements in unsealed fibre sheeting and is also common to aged, brittle corrugated asbestos-cement roofing.

An update from the EPA, released on 20 February 2024, revealed that the investigation into asbestos-contaminated mulch returned six positive results and more than 100 negative results in the past day. There are now a total of 47 positive sites, with 796 tests returning negative results since 10 January.

The City of Sydney Council reported one sample of friable asbestos and several samples for bonded asbestos in mulch at Bicentennial Park 1, Glebe, which is part of the Glebe foreshore area. The EPA is awaiting further details from those test results, but the council has fenced off the affected area of the parklands. Five other sites returned positive results for bonded asbestos, including North Rosebery Park, Rosebery (site is secured); a private aged care facility in St Ives (site is being secured); an industrial area in Rouse Hill (site is being secured); a private property (not publicly accessible); and Mary Mackillop Catholic Parish, Oran Park (site is secured).

Mary Mackillop Catholic Parish is in close proximity to St Justin’s Catholic Parish Primary School and St Benedict’s Catholic College in Oran Park; while mulch has only been identified on Parish property, precautionary testing will be conducted at both schools. Precautionary testing will also be conducted at four hospitals, including Westmead Hospital, Sydney Children’s Hospital, Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital and Nepean Hospital, as well as two ambulance stations in Tumut and Woy Woy. Impacted areas at these sites will be cordoned off.

The EPA has also assured households that only a small number of residential properties have tested positive to bonded asbestos in mulch. The EPA is also providing a licensed asbestos assessor and, if necessary, a contractor to remove the mulch.

Greens MP and spokesperson for the Environment Sue Higginson called for an “urgent and at scale” mobilisation of resources, led by the NSW Government, to discover how many mulch businesses have been distributing asbestos to schools, hospitals and playgrounds.

“We knew two weeks ago that the asbestos at the Rozelle Parklands was just the tip of the iceberg and that more contamination discoveries were inevitable. The Environment Protection Authority is responding as best they can, but the sheer scale of this issue cannot be overstated. Around 13% of mulch tested by the EPA over the last 2 weeks has returned positive results for asbestos. This is unacceptably high and we don’t even know how many mulch providers may be dealing with contaminated materials, let alone where else asbestos will turn up in the coming weeks and months,” Higginson said.

Higginson also called for a moratorium on the movement of materials that may be contaminated, to prevent more asbestos from being distributed while the EPA is chasing down leads. “The former government ignored these issues when they were first raised, they prioritised corporate interests over community and environmental safety. NSW needs to urgently start tracing potentially contaminated materials and consider how we solve this issue. Investment in a circular economy that is informed by human and environmental safety and backed up with rigorous liability and enforcement is the only way we can tackle this issue,” Higginson said.

7,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"SafeWork NSW has issued almost $1 million in fines at the halfway point of its ‘Working at Heights in Construction’ campaign. The safety blitz was implemented after a concerning rise in the number of serious injuries and deaths attributed to falls from heights, with 17 people killed between 2018 and 2022.

As part of the safety blitz, inspectors from SafeWork NSW visited commercial and residential sites across the state, as well as conducting high-visibility checks in manufacturing and warehouse industries. They also conducted inspections in the transport industries in the lead-up to Christmas. Since May 2023, the inspectors have visited 1218 worksites resulting in 1499 Improvement Notices, 727 Prohibition Notices and 352 Penalty Notices, amounting to $972,000.

During these inspections, the inspectors determined that approximately 65% of the industry is using the highest form of safety measure as its first choice, including the use of fall prevention devices such as roof guardrails and scaffolding, rather than fall arrest systems such as harnesses.

The campaign will continue in 2024, commencing with a blitz on the safe installation of rooftop solar panels in February. Contractors and builders are obligated to protect workers by identifying height risks and taking steps to control these hazards as far as is reasonably practicable by implementing higher order controls.

Trent Curtin, Head of SafeWork NSW, said that while it is encouraging that 65% of the industry is using the highest form of safety measure, it means that 35% is not, and this needs to change.

“As we pass the halfway point of SafeWork’s ‘Working at Heights in Construction’ compliance blitz, it is important to note that falls from heights is still the number one cause of traumatic fatalities on NSW construction sites. During one worksite blitz, a SafeWork inspector noted a worker who was not connected to a harness system while working on a roof. When questioned as to why they were not connected, the worker reasoned that they had been roofing for 30 years without an incident. Attitudes like this will eventually result in a workplace accident or death. This is simply unacceptable. SafeWork inspectors will not hesitate to stop work onsite, issue fines and consider prosecution against businesses and individuals disregarding the rules,” Curtin said.

Workers who are concerned about workplace health and safety can anonymously contact SafeWork on 13 10 50 or through the ‘Speak Up Save Lives’ app. For more information about working from heights, visit the SafeWork NSW website.

8,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Researchers from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) have shown that air conditioning in the workplace can help trap particles from bushfire smoke and reduce exposure to potentially harmful elements like soluble mercury, sulfate and nitrate. Bushfire smoke can cause or exacerbate health conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart disease. The study, published in the journal Environmental Pollution, was led by UTS PhD candidate Raissa Gill.

“The bushfires that raged across Australia during the 2019–2020 ‘Black Summer’ produced an enormous amount of air pollution, with plumes of smoke travelling long distances and cloaking Sydney and surrounding areas,” Gill said.

The researchers used commercial air conditioning filters to capture and analyse the chemical composition of particles that would otherwise be inhaled. The researchers collected particulate matter from heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) filters in UTS Buildings 4 and 7 during the peak of the Black Summer bushfires as well as one year later as a reference point. Research findings revealed that daily particulate matter concentrations were two to three times higher than normal, with hourly concentrations reaching up to 10.5 times the usual maximum. This exceeded the national standards on 19% of days across the four-month sampling window. The particles were also finer and contained a mixture of toxic chemicals.

Co-author and UTS Professor Martina Doblin said the bushfire aerosols contained smaller, rounder particles than urban aerosols. These are more likely to be inhaled into lungs and to transfer toxic elements into our bloodstream. “These particles also contained more soluble forms of mercury, as well as higher concentrations of sulfate, nitrate and fluoride ions and metals including manganese, cobalt and antimony. Mercury is quite toxic even in low concentrations and can cause neurological problems and lung damage,” Doblin said.

The study also found that bushfire events exert a range of chemical changes to the atmosphere; understanding these changes can help assess the impact of bushfires and their potential consequences for human health and environmental quality. While HVAC systems are not designed specifically for bushfire smoke, research on indoor air quality in Canberra during the 2019–2020 bushfires showed that outdoor concentrations of fine particulate matter were up to 10 times higher than measured values indoors with air conditioning.

The UTS HVAC filters captured a significant portion of bushfire smoke, reducing exposure to toxic particles for staff and students working in these buildings. The research also highlighted the importance of considering higher-rated HVAC filters during fire seasons and maintaining and replacing the filters regularly.

“Given that severe bushfires are projected to increase with climate change, the role of bushfire-ready infrastructure in maintaining public health, as well as the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, is now more pressing than ever,” Gill said.

9,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Workplaces across the Northern Territory have been urged to ensure that their workers are protected from melioidosis. On 23 January 2024, a worker at a Darwin landscaping company was reportedly diagnosed with melioidosis after attending hospital due to persistent back pain. Initial investigations found that the worker was completing gardening work days before being diagnosed. However, due to the delay in symptoms, the exact location where the worker may have contracted melioidosis cannot be determined. The worker has since commenced medical treatment, which includes ongoing intravenous antibiotics.

Melioidosis is a disease caused by bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei, commonly found in tropical soils and water. In the Northern Territory, melioidosis usually occurs during the wet season (October to April), when heavy rainfall can bring the bacteria into surface water and soil. The bacteria can cause infection when it enters a person’s body through skin cuts and sores or through the inhalation of dust or droplets. Workers exposed to environments where the bacteria may be present are at risk of contracting melioidosis, which can be fatal if not treated immediately.

NT WorkSafe has urged all workplaces with workers working outdoors, especially during the wet season, to implement a range of measures to protect their workers. Workplaces are urged to carry out hazard identification, risk assessment and control (HIRAC) before starting any job in a work environment that can potentially be contaminated by bacteria causing melioidosis. Employers should also consider the available control measures and implement them to eliminate or minimise the risk of contracting the disease.

Control measures can include the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as glasses, respirators, gloves and appropriate footwear for workers, along with the provision of adequate washing facilities. Employers must also ensure that workers adopt personal hygiene practices such as washing their hands thoroughly before and after eating, drinking, smoking and performing their job. Workers must also check their skin before carrying out work to identify any cuts, abrasions or wounds — these must be properly covered with waterproof dressings and appropriate PPE.

Alternatively, workers with open cuts and sores should be deployed to other tasks, including workers who have pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, kidney and lung disease, which increase their risk of contracting melioidosis. Workers must also receive the appropriate information, training and/or instruction about the potential risks and symptoms of melioidosis, the use of PPE, hand-washing practices and safe work procedures.

Workers who experience any of the symptoms of melioidosis are advised to contact their employer and seek medical help as soon as possible.

10,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Employers and workers across Western Australia have been urged to consider all the precautions that should be taken when work is being undertaken in remote areas. Workers who regularly travel to remote areas of the state include tour operators and workers involved in supervising various recreational activities; mining workers such as prospectors and geologists; truck drivers; and some farmers.

Acting WorkSafe Commissioner Sally North said it is important to remember that employers and workers have responsibilities for health and safety when working in remote areas. “While anyone who travels to the outback needs to consider safety when deciding what to take with them, we would particularly like to remind both employers and workers that they have responsibilities under workplace health and safety laws,” North said.

Much of WA is remote with reduced access to regular communications, emergency assistance and medical aid. As a result, employers must assess the risks and equip workers with what is required to reduce the risks. Work vehicle breakdowns can leave workers stranded in remote areas, so appropriate vehicles must be used for the tasks being undertaken, with spare parts and recovery equipment provided with the vehicle.

A reliable form of communication or an alert system are also vital for safety; WorkSafe WA urges employers to provide equipment such as a satellite phone, GPS tracker, personal locator beacon or EPIRB, as well as a communication plan including regular check-ins. Workers must also receive adequate training and instruction. Employers are also advised to review current weather conditions, including fire risks or fire events, before and during travel.

“Anyone who travels to WA’s remote areas, whether they do so for work or for recreation, needs to be aware of the risks involved. Many of these risks can be life-threatening, so it’s crucial that everyone is aware of them and what they need to do to reduce or eliminate them,” North said.

Workers who regularly travel to remote areas of the state include tour operators and workers involved in supervising various recreational activities; mining workers such as prospectors and geologists; truck drivers; and some farmers.
Acting WorkSafe Commissioner Sally North said it is important to remember that employers and workers have responsibilities for health and safety when working in remote areas.
As a result, employers must assess the risks and equip workers with what is required to reduce the risks.

11,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Victoria University’s Sir Zelman Cowen Centre (SZCC), in partnership with WorkSafe Victoria, will establish a network of workplaces to help prevent and respond to gendered violence at work. WorkSafe’s WorkWell Respect Network will bring workplaces together through events and learning opportunities.

Program managers Annie Wohlgehagen and Rubina Habib from the SZCC said the Network will provide adaptable resources and a safe learning space for 300 participants from high-risk industries such as finance, insurance, information and communication technology, hospitality and operations. “The team at SZCC are aware of the intersecting factors that can exacerbate gendered violence at work, and we have expertise around it,” Habib said.

Work-related gendered violence includes any behaviour that affects the health and safety of someone because of their gender or sexual orientation, or because they don’t conform to gender stereotypes. It can include sexual harassment, stalking, verbal abuse, unwelcome comments or gestures, and threats or physical violence. It can involve colleagues, supervisors, clients and customers.

The WorkWell Respect Network was established in response to a recommendation by the Ministerial Taskforce on Workplace Sexual Harassment. The report suggested expanding WorkWell to include dedicated actions to prevent work-related gendered violence and workplace sexual harassment. Minister for WorkSafe and the TAC Danny Pearson said everyone should feel safe and respected in their workplace, regardless of their gender.

“We’re helping industries tailor new approaches to prevent and respond to work-related gendered violence, through improved policies, training and resources that create safe environments for all Victorian workers,” Pearson said.

WorkWell will also support evidence-based programs that aim to create industry-wide change. Initiatives will be developed and run by Gippsland Women’s Health, the Health and Community Services Union, Your Community Health and Women’s Health in the South East, and will be delivered across a range of industries.

12,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The South Australian Government has announced that it will form a new apprentice and trainee safety committee in 2024, as part of its commitment to prioritise apprenticeship safety. The new Apprentice and Trainee Training and Safety Committee will be chaired by SA Skills Commissioner Cameron Baker, and will comprise organisations that have responsibilities for oversight of apprentice and trainee training, safety and wellbeing, including SafeWork SA.

The new Apprentice and Trainee Training and Safety Committee will begin work in March to ensure additional on-job training and safe workplace initiatives for the state’s apprentices and trainees. It will also include representatives of those who will be impacted by the work — providing an avenue for direct guidance from apprentices and trainees, with the Apprentice of the Year, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Student of the Year and Trainee of the Year all on the committee.

The South Australian Government previously took action in 2023 to improve apprenticeship education and safety. This was achieved by conducting proactive outreach to over 1700 employers to educate them on their responsibilities in relation to their apprentices and trainees. The state government also investigated 36 employers for non-compliance with their obligations and imposed 18 sanctions upon non-compliant employers.

The main types of non-compliance investigated in 2023 include failures to provide adequate and/or appropriate supervision (this would include issues associated with bullying and harassment); failures to release apprentices for training or to adequately progress them in their training (including not letting them attend off-job training); and failure to provide the full scope of work to enable apprentices to achieve competency across all aspects of the trade or vocation.

The most common regulatory response is applying conditions to an employer’s registration. Common conditions include requirements for the employer to provide evidence of appropriate supervision or training, to limit employers from taking on new apprentices or hosting apprentices without a risk assessment by the Department first, and ensuring the apprentice understands their rights and obligations and where to seek assistance if required.

Further sanctions include prohibiting an employer from employing apprentices and cancelling their registration, suspending an employer’s registration and issuing compliance notices requiring employers to take specific actions to correct non-compliances. SA Skills Commissioner Cameron Baker said the South Australian Skills Commission is committed to supporting safe workplace initiatives.

“Helping apprentices navigate workplaces for the first time and ensuring they are provided with the on-job training they signed up for, and their safety, both physical and psychological, are key priorities for me and the team at the Skills Commission. The formation of the Apprentice and Trainee Training and Safety Committee is an important step in protecting some of the state’s most vulnerable workers,” Baker said.

The course consists of three units, with the first focusing on mining work health and safety, developed in partnership with ECU’s School of Medical and Health Sciences.

The second unit, Leading Respect at Work, focuses on workplace culture, barriers to respect at work and new legislation around psychosocial hazards in the workplace. The Graduate Certificate was developed in partnership with the Western Australian Government’s Mental Awareness, Respect and Safety (MARS) Program. MARS Course Coordinator Dr Esme Franken said the Graduate Certificate aims to enable current and emerging leaders to advance initiatives around mentally healthy and safe workspaces within the resources sector.

“We are also focusing on sexual harassment as well as bullying, which were flagged as major causes of concern in the mining sector over the past few years, including in the Enough is Enough and Respect at Work reports,” Franken said.

The final unit, Managing People and Organisations, is an existing unit within ECU’s Master of Business Administration course which has been adapted and refined for the mining industry. MARS Centre Director Professor Tim Bentley said the Graduate Certificate is unique amongst the currently available courses for the sector as its focus encompasses psychosocial risk, respect at work, and physical health and safety.

“The sector is still coming to grips with the issue of psychosocial risk. Mining organisations have the challenge of managing these issues from a risk-based approach. That will be addressed during this course, and students will be empowered to lead a mentally healthy and respectful workplace. The more leaders and future leaders that go through this course, the bigger the shift will be in culture,” Bentley said.

Graduates from the course will also become part of the MARS Alumni, allowing them access to continued professional development and support. The MARS Centre is an ECU industry collaboration aimed at creating mentally healthy workplaces, building a culture of safety and respect, and preparing for workplace safety in future mining.

14,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Inspectors from SafeWork NSW will ensure businesses in the state’s construction and tunnelling industries are compliant with regulations and will speak to workers about managing the risk of exposure to silica dust as part of a six-month safety campaign.

While manufactured stone is the leading cause of silicosis, workers can also be exposed to silica dust during tunnelling, demolition and excavation work, or from uncontrolled cutting, grinding and drilling of common building materials such as bricks, concrete, sandstone and tiles. SafeWork NSW inspectors will target these areas to prevent a false sense of security ahead of the coming ban on manufactured stone in NSW.

Silicosis is a deadly disease that has devastating effects on the lungs and is becoming prevalent in Australian workers, especially those in the engineered stone industry. SafeWork inspectors can issue stop work notices for activities that generate high levels of dust, or when a worksite hasn’t got adequate dust control measures in place. If these notices are not complied with, employers can face penalties of up to $130,000.

The NSW Government has also announced plans to establish a silica worker register, to track and trace exposed workers and enable early intervention. Minister for Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis said the safety campaign aims to protect workers who may be exposed to the risks of silica dust and will help ensure safer workplaces in NSW.

“Exposure to silica dust is an incredibly serious issue for workers in a range of industries and we must learn from the hard lessons of asbestos,” Cotsis said.

15,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The South Australian Government has introduced regulations to help workers and employers manage the risk of psychological injuries and illnesses in the workplace. The changes to the regulations under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 came into effect on 25 December 2023, to help provide better guidance to workers and employers.

Psychological illnesses can significantly affect workers’ health, as well as business productivity. There has been a growing recognition of the need for the work health and safety framework to better address the risks of psychological harm. The new regulations reflect the outcomes of an independent review of Australia’s model work health and safety laws conducted in 2018, which recommended more specific guidance for how to identify and manage psychosocial risks.

Psychosocial hazards are hazards that may cause psychological harm; examples include excessive workload demands, exposure to traumatic events and material, bullying, harassment and sexual discrimination in the workplace. The regulations will be supported by a Code of Practice on Managing Psychosocial Hazards at Work, which will provide guidance on how to manage the risks to psychological health.

SafeWork SA Executive Director Glenn Farrell said that the regulations and code of practice will help businesses ensure that their workers are free from harm at work. “SafeWork SA will be working with employer and employee organisations to push out guidance material to help business owners understand their obligations,” Farrell said.

Minister for Industrial Relations and Public Sector Kyam Maher said the regulations are part of a national effort to better address the risks caused by psychosocial hazards at work and recognise that a worker’s psychological health is just as important as their physical health. “I look forward to continuing to work with both business and worker representatives to improve health and safety in South Australian workplaces,” Maher said.

16,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Research has shown that workers with disability are over-represented in the gig economy and are more likely to work casual hours — for that reason, new employment laws that seek to allow the introduction of minimum standards for these workers cannot be delayed further, according to Slater and Gordon Lawyers. These minimum standards include pay, penalty rates, superannuation, payment terms, record-keeping, insurance, representation, consultation, working time and a right to annual leave depending on the worker’s situation.

Slater and Gordon Lawyer in Industrial and Employment law Cassandra Grey said that a significant number of people with disabilities rely on gig economy work to help meet their basic needs of daily life. The Final Report of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability outlined the evidence received by the Disability Royal Commission about the widespread wage theft among firms that hired disabled workers as well as recommendations to ensure inclusive employment for workers with disabilities.

The Australian Human Rights Council found that people with disability are more likely than others to work casual hours and work in the gig economy. This means that they are still working without minimum standards and secure pay, as the cost of living increases. Grey said that gig economy workers can have low bargaining power and low authority over their work, often receiving pay at or below the rates of comparable employees, without the security and protection afforded to employees under Australian industrial relations law.

“This just demonstrates how vital it is to enshrine workers’ rights in these industries, so no workers with disabilities continue to slip through the cracks and the human right of disabled people to be employed in just and favourable conditions can be fully realised. People with disabilities already face tremendous hurdles in the workforce, including finding suitable employment, accessing reasonable adjustments, prejudicial attitudes of employers, discrimination and wage theft. So it’s disappointing, but unsurprising that they’re having to turn to the gig economy to make ends meet,” Grey said.

Under the proposed reforms, the Fair Work Commission will take steps to ensure gig economy workers receive added workplace protections. The changes will also make wage theft a criminal offence throughout Australia, increase civil penalties for underpayment offences, prevent employers paying labour hire employees lower rates of pay than their direct employees and amend the defence available to employers who are accused of sham contracts.

“These reforms for gig economy and casual workers would positively impact many vulnerable workers who can face substantial power imbalances up against large digital platform employers and should not be delayed. Workers with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to being left behind and it’s imperative that our industrial relations system protects the rights of all workers,” Grey said.

While the new laws strengthen national efforts to eliminate these unlawful behaviours in workplaces, it is important to note that the positive duty under the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (SDA) — and the AHRC’s compliance powers — do not change existing duties or regulatory functions in the Commonwealth work health and safety (WHS) jurisdiction.

18,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"SafeWork NSW has urged workers and businesses to start planning for how they will stay safe as the temperature rises over the summer. Employers have the primary duty of care for employees and are encouraged to develop a workplace heat management plan in consultation with health and safety representatives and workers, to ensure everyone stays safe over summer.

Information about developing a heat management plan and managing extreme heat in the workplace is available on the SafeWork website. Heat-related illnesses occur when the body starts to overheat due to working too hard to cool itself down. Symptoms can include dehydration, fainting, heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

Employers who have workers completing tasks outside are advised to eliminate extended periods of sun exposure by providing shade, rotating tasks to reduce exposure, scheduling work to cooler times of the day and providing personal protective equipment such as hats, long-sleeve shirts and sunscreen. Trent Curtin, Head of SafeWork NSW, reminded workers to listen to their body when the temperature rises and to drink plenty of water, adding that it is vital to ensure that water is not replaced with soft drinks, energy drinks or coffee as these can dehydrate you further.

“As the weather gets warmer it is important businesses and workers start to talk about the procedures they will use to keep everyone safe from heat-related illnesses. We don’t want to see anyone needing medical attention due to heat exposure. If the weather becomes too hot and can’t be avoided then the job might have to be stopped. Worker safety must come first,” Curtin said.

Workers who feel that their workplace is unsafe can anonymously report their concerns directly to SafeWork NSW on 13 10 50 or through the ‘Speak Up Save Lives’ app.

20,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Researchers from Tampere University in Finland and the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) in Italy have published an overview of global estimates of work-related diseases and occupational injuries. When investigating mortality caused by work-related diseases, the researchers found an increase of 26% from 2011–2019.

The study provides global, regional and country-level estimates of the burden of occupational diseases and work-related accidents. It also investigated the burden in terms of deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and economic loss as a percentage of the total gross domestic product (GDP). The researchers also analysed the DALYs attributable to psychosocial exposures at work.

As mortality does not give a complete picture of the burden of disease borne by individuals in different populations, the overall burden of disease was assessed using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) indicator. DALY combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of life lost due to time lived in states of less than full health, or years of healthy life lost due to disability. One DALY represents the loss of one year of full health.

Dr Subas Neupane, Senior Research Fellow at Tampere University, said the burden of work-related diseases is a global health challenge, with updated estimates needed to understand the trends in the work-related burden of diseases, working conditions and their impact on workers’ health.

Work-related deaths and DALYs estimates for a group of seven major diseases covering 120 at-risk outcome pairs attributable to work were calculated at the global and WHO regional levels, along with the country level for 181 countries. The results showed that, in 2019, 2.9 million deaths were attributed to work, 2.58 million deaths were due to work-related diseases and 0.32 million deaths to occupational injuries. The study also found that globally, work-related diseases with a long latency period are increasing while the number of occupational injuries has decreased.

Work-related circulatory diseases were the major cause of 912,000 deaths globally, followed by 843,000 deaths attributed to work-related cancer. However, in high-income American, Eastern European and Western Pacific WHO regions, work-related cancer was the biggest disease group. DALYs attributable to work were estimated to be 180 million in 2019. The economic loss was 5.8% of the global GDP. Researchers suggest that the recently included estimates of psychosocial factors increased the global loss.

“There is a considerable regional and country variation in the burden of work-related diseases. A concerted and sustainable global effort to promote health and safety in the workplace is imperative to mitigate the burden of work-related diseases and accidents,” Neupane said.

The research findings provide an overview and an update of the global estimates of occupational injuries and work-related diseases made over the past 25 years by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

RSHQ’s Chief Operating Officer Rob Djukic said there have been issues in previous years with fabric building structures like igloos being unable to withstand loads. Lightning strikes have also been known to cause tyre explosions at mine sites. Djukic said igloos should never be considered a place of safety during severe weather events. “Those structures need regular maintenance, but don’t just stop there. Make sure you’re assessing all site facilities deemed to be places of safety during severe weather events,” Djukic said.

Mine sites are encouraged to cease operations when lightning is detected within an appropriately determined distance from the worksite, with all vehicles driven to a designated safe lay-down area. Operators of vehicles should also be transported to a safe shelter away from the equipment, with workers not to return on site until an ‘all clear’ has been given.

22,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A study conducted and released by Margot Faraci, a management expert and senior leader in Australia with 20 years’ experience at Macquarie Bank, NAB, CBA and more, has revealed that toxic leadership is fuelling thousands of Australian businesses, with 27% harbouring unconscious fear. A third of corporate managers are primarily motivated by fear, creating less efficient and less psychologically safe work environments that reportedly cost $2.3 billion annually in lost productivity.

Fearful leadership isn’t just shouting or aggressive behaviour, it includes avoidance, complacency, decision fatigue, hesitancy to express viewpoints, fear of letting people down, micromanagement, reluctance to provide feedback, not creating space for others to speak up, holding back growth opportunities from others and more. Fearful leadership can stem from inexperience and low self-confidence, leading to increased stress, fatigue and compromised decision-making. It is also attributed to past experiences, creating an ongoing cycle of leadership driven by fear.

Fearful leaders in Australia lose an estimated $26,263 in a year (based on their salary and estimated hours lost), equalling a $2.3 billion cost in productivity across Australia. Seven in ten (69%) of managers also believe that stress and fear can be used as a positive or motivational tool, despite acknowledging its adverse effects on performance, wellbeing and company culture.

The findings are part of a global study by Faraci which analysed the leadership behaviours of 2500 managers in Australia, the UK and US in order to uncover unconscious fear in leadership. The challenge is that thousands of leaders are often unaware that they’re leading with fear or coming from a fearful response.

The study found that 69% of fearful leaders in Australia believe that stress can be positively harnessed in workplaces, while 87% of fearful leaders in Australia regularly witness declines in team productivity due to toxic leadership. While the majority of leaders offer guidance and learning opportunities, fearful leaders are more likely to either be fully hands on or hands off when it comes to trusting their direct reports.

Almost half (49%) of fearful leaders in Australia reported struggling with decision fatigue, while 38% of fearful leaders regularly witnessed declines in team morale. 51% are unhappy with their job and 23% say workplace relationships are strained. Fearful leaders also tend to shift the blame, believing management is at fault for declining productivity, largely due to micromanagement and lack of communication.

Faraci said that fearful leadership manifests in subtle yet corrosive ways in daily interactions and is reflected in overly controlling management styles, where leaders micromanage every aspect, stifling creativity and autonomy. According to Faraci, fearful leaders might prioritise short-term gains over long-term employee wellbeing, inadvertently fostering a tense and anxious work environment, with these actions stemming from an unconscious fear of losing control.

“Fearful leadership is fuelling Australian, and worldwide, businesses. I’ve seen it for decades and the majority of managers aren’t often aware they’re leading with fear or coming from a fearful response. It’s hardwired into our subconscious because it’s what we’ve been exposed to throughout our careers,” Faraci said.

Faraci has called for managers and leaders to acknowledge and confront their fears to break the cycle. “The opposite of leading with fear is leading with love. People think of love as a romantic connection between two people, but it’s more than that. Love includes trust, compassion, vulnerability, respect and other sentiments needed to create psychologically safe environments. It takes a level of self-awareness to reach a love-based response,” Faraci said.

The regulatory implementation project, spearheaded by the NSW Resources Regulator within the Department of Regional NSW, used the new legislation to ensure the safety of workers.

The Work Health and Safety (Mines and Petroleum Sites) Regulation 2022 introduced new guidelines and requirements to enhance safety standards in the mining industry. The key objective of this project was to ensure that mine operators were fully aware of these changes and were taking the appropriate measures to comply with the law.

The Resources Regulator completed a compliance program, targeting small above-ground mines (Tier 2A), to assess how operators are implementing the regulation changes. Of the 44 mines the Resources Regulator inspected, 30 of them were issued 34 notices including eight improvement notices and 26 notices of concern, relating to compliance with new legislation, including updating safety management plans, communicating changes to mine workers, notification of high-risk activities, and updating statutory functions.

Day urged mine operators to conduct regular reviews of their systems to ensure that compliance is being met consistently. “Diligence is key to keeping our mine workers safe and it’s the responsibility of the operator to meet their obligations under the Work Health and Safety (Mines and Petroleum Sites) Regulation 2022,” Day said.

24,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The ‘HEART 5’ mobile health unit that travels around Queensland will be offering free lung checks to former miners and quarry workers on the Sunshine Coast from 12–13 December 2023. The truck is fully equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment to provide the required screening examinations, including a lung function test and chest X-ray, and any tests needed to investigate possible abnormalities, such as high-resolution CT scans.

Since its launch in February 2022, free checks on board the HEART 5 have detected dozens of cases of mine dust lung diseases, like black lung and silicosis, in former mine and quarry workers across regional and remote Queensland. Graham Bowcock, 75, has urged all former and retired mine and quarry workers to have their free lung check. In 2020, Bowcock was diagnosed with lung cancer and silicosis after spending 37 years working in mineral mines in North West Queensland. He was told by his treating specialist that he’d have no more than six months to live unless he had emergency surgery.

Following Bowcock’s initial diagnosis and treatment, he contacted Resources Safety and Health Queensland (RSHQ) after hearing about their free lung health check program. The program helped him confirm his diagnosis as a mine dust lung disease and connected him with the Mine Dust Health Support Service to access compensation and support.

Evan Pengelly, Director of RSHQ’s Health Surveillance Unit, said the program allows former and retired mine and quarry workers to access medical testing for free, and can cover travel expenses too. “I really urge all former and retired mine and quarry workers to have their free lung check. Lung disease can sometimes take 10 years or more to develop after a worker finishes in the industry. If you are diagnosed early that means you can access treatment as soon as possible, potentially slow the progression of disease, and apply for workers compensation entitlements. These tests can be life changing for workers like Graham,” Pengelly said.

Bowcock had part of his lung removed two days before his 71st birthday. Now he’s about to turn 74, and while he still has pain and struggles to breathe with certain exercises, he is grateful for the time he has left.

25,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A University of Adelaide and Oxford University study has discovered asbestos exposure led to a higher incidence of asbestos-related lung cancers in British and Australian naval personnel than in other armed forces.

The data was collected from 30,085 United Kingdom and Australian personnel who served in the 1950s and 1960s, a time when asbestos-containing materials were present in British and Australian naval vessels. Three of the four cohorts had previously been studied by the University of Adelaide and the UK Health Security Agency to identify the effects of radiation exposure from British nuclear testing; however, a raised incidence of mesothelioma, a cancer strongly linked to asbestos exposure, was seen in naval personnel in all cohorts.

The University of Adelaide’s Dr Richie Gun and Oxford University’s Dr Gerry Kendall were prompted by this finding to examine the dataset for the occurrence of lung cancers, which can also arise from asbestos exposure. The fourth cohort was Australian veterans of the Korean War, which had been studied by the Australian Department of Veterans Affairs and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare.

“We found the lung cancer rate was higher overall in naval personnel than in the other armed services, and, while smoking remains the dominant cause of lung cancer, it is unlikely the excess could be explained by a higher smoking rate in the navy. Although actual measurements of airborne asbestos levels were not available, and estimates are difficult, we have concluded that the higher lung cancer rate in sailors was most probably caused by onboard asbestos exposure. This conclusion was strengthened by the occurrence of deaths in sailors from asbestosis, a condition which is non-cancerous but is nevertheless disabling and potentially fatal,” Gun said.

The researchers have estimated that the proportion of lung cancers related to onboard asbestos exposure were of the order of 27% in Australian seamen and 12% in British seamen.

While there is a ban on imports and strict regulatory control of asbestos-containing materials in Australia, they still pose a risk to workers and some householders. There were 142 cases of asbestosis and 111 asbestosis deaths in 2021–2022 reported in the New South Wales Dust Diseases Register.

Gun said the effects of asbestos exposure are likely being underestimated unless lung cancer is considered alongside mesothelioma and asbestosis.

“Although it remains true that smoking causes most lung cancers, other agents such as asbestos can contribute to the incidence of cancer in an exposed population. Moreover, we know from other studies that the combination of smoking and asbestos exposure has an enhanced influence on lung cancer risk; this interactive effect would have contributed to the observed lung cancer excess,” Gun said.

The discovery of a link between asbestos exposure and a higher incidence of lung cancer is a timely reminder of the need for protection against exposure to other harmful airborne dusts.

“Strict control measures are required to protect workers potentially exposed not only to asbestos but to other hazardous dusts, such as dust from engineered stone now installed in many kitchens,” Gun said.

26,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"WorkSafe ACT has begun to enforce the code of practice for managing the risks of silica dust in the workplace. On 15 November 2023, Managing the Risks of Airborne Crystalline Silica (Silica Dust) in the Workplace Code of Practice came into effect. This code supports the safety regulator’s commitment to tackle exposure to silica dust and provides duty holders and workers with the information they need to comply. The code includes information about identifying the hazard, air monitoring, health monitoring, controlling the risks, maintenance of control measures and safe work method statements (SWMS).

WorkSafe ACT has upskilled its inspectors and formed a dedicated Occupational Hygiene team that will focus on workplaces that work with engineered stone and silica containing materials. Work Health and Safety (WHS) Commissioner Jacqueline Agius said she wants duty holders to understand just how dangerous silica dust is and welcomed the code at such a critical time.

“We continue to see non-compliance, with failures to protect workers from silica dust. This code provides businesses with information about what must be done to comply. We must take a stand, take action; and use the new code of practice to ensure workers are protected from silica dust that comes from all materials — not just engineered stone, but also materials like concrete and bricks and other natural stones,” Agius said.

Duty holders in the ACT have had a grace period to implement controls, train their workers and to comply with their obligations. “I have made it very clear that workers MUST be protected from the risks of silica dust, and WorkSafe ACT inspectors will continue to be out in force and respond to any reports of dry cutting or non-compliance,” Agius said.

The code of practice supports the WHS Regulation 2011 and provides information about what unsafe practices might look like, what control measures must be used to prevent exposure to silica dust and what training workers must complete. However, eliminating the hazard is the first principle of protecting workers, and Agius welcomed the ACT Government’s position about banning engineered stone products.

“We can and must prevent exposure. Using engineered stone is a choice. We do not need to use it. I have stated previously my position on banning this product and I applaud the ACT Government and Minister Gentleman for supporting a national ban,” Agius said.

28,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"CSIRO has announced that it will partner with five universities to keep Australians safe at work using the latest digital technologies. The $18 million Tech4HSE program will enable researchers in emerging fields such as generative and immersive artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality and cybersecurity to develop technology to aid those working in dangerous environments.

CSIRO’s data and digital arm, Data61, joined forces with the University of Queensland, Swinburne University, UNSW, Curtin University and Australian National University for the program. Professor Aaron Quigley, Science Director of Data61, said the technologies developed will support health, safety and environmental (HSE) objectives across a range of industries. “We’re bringing the best researchers in the nation together to help get everyone home safely, by creating advanced digital tools for training, identifying and monitoring hazards, and planning responses and actions,” Quigley said.

Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that 497,300 Australians suffered from a work-related injury or illness in 2021–22. All participating institutions will contribute funding and research expertise to the program, with UQ administering the funding. UQ Tech4HSE Science Lead Dr Mashhuda Glencross said the project represents an opportunity to make a difference. “The innovative technologies we are researching and developing in this initiative are aimed at supporting the safety of Australians during disasters and when working in potentially hazardous environments,” Glencross said.

Prototypes will be built over five years and trialled in real-world job scenarios to develop commercially viable products that are responsible by design. The first project currently underway involves researchers from Data61 and UQ developing technologies to support crisis preparedness and response for workers in the energy industry. Data61 Tech4HSE Science Lead Dr Matt Adcock said one example of the technology being developed combines computer vision models and 3D generative AI.

“Our aim is to take smart glasses to a new level by enabling the placement of helpful digital holograms within the physical work environment to support emergency response safety training and assisted decision-making under heightened stress levels,” Adcock said.

Researchers are also working with stakeholders in the power industry to ensure prototypes are sensitive to industry needs. The program strategically aims to bring Australia’s university expertise and CSIRO’s capabilities together to maximise the impact of science, research and development for Australians.

29,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Since 3 July 2023, inspectors from SafeWork SA have performed 53 compliance audits, issuing 314 statutory notices and more than 100 stop-work notices to halt risky practices on building sites, as part of a six-month safety blitz targeting working from height. The ‘managing risk of falls in residential construction’ campaign identified 172 breaches, resulting in 124 prohibition and 48 improvement notices being issued.

Working from portable ladders and scaffolds or working near balconies, voids and live edges are the biggest areas of concern. To support the Communications Electrical Plumbing Union’s (CEPU) ‘Nowhere to go’ campaign, the campaign also includes ensuring accessibility to clean and hygienic toilet facilities. The toilets compliance audits identified 41 breaches resulting in improvement notices being issued. Almost three-quarters of compliance audits identified non-compliant toilet facilities.

During the audits, an additional 101 statutory notices were issued for non-campaign related breaches, consisting of 17 prohibition and 84 improvement notices. A prohibition notice is a directive issued to an employer, instructing them to stop work immediately due to the severity of the risk until compliance measures are implemented to mitigate the workplace hazard. Improvement notices are issued when a safe issue is identified. Work can continue while the improvement notice is being actioned; however, the notice requires the issue to be fixed within a specified time.

Slips, trips and falls made up a substantial number of workplace incidents, with falls from height being the third leading cause of workplace fatalities across Australia. In 2022, SafeWork SA recorded 77 notifiable serious injuries resulting from falls, down from 103 in 2021, with 59 of those falls occurring within the construction industry — the worst affected of all industries. Falls from ladders comprised 40% of construction industry fall injuries in 2022, with data revealing that workers most at risk of a serious injury from a fall were roofers, carpenters and steel frame installers.

While the number of incidents across all industries has decreased in the past two years, falls in the residential construction industry remain high. SafeWork SA Executive Director Glenn Farrell said inspectors will continue to visit construction sites in November and December.

“Key safety messages about working from heights are not leading to a reduction in injuries in the residential construction sector, requiring a more rigorous approach to compliance. The control measures to reduce the risk of falls are well known and readily available so there is no excuse for not having them in place,” Farrell said.

Workplace sexual harassment occurs in every industry and is unacceptably prevalent in Australia, with data from the Australian Human Rights Commission revealing that a third of Australians have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.

Work is underway to curb sexual harassment in the workplace in NSW, with SafeWork NSW launching a four-year strategy to eliminate workplace sexual harassment. This new, dedicated team will focus on addressing gender-based harmful workplace behaviours and lead the implementation of the strategy. This includes educating NSW businesses on their duties to prevent and respond to workplace sexual harassment before it occurs and take appropriate enforcement action to protect workers.

The NSW Respect at Work Advisory Group will be led by SafeWork NSW and supported by Minister Sophie Cotsis and Minister Jodie Harrison. The advisory group will also inform the government’s approach to stopping workplace sexual harassment and ensure efforts are coordinated with key NSW and Commonwealth Government agencies working to address sexual harassment.

The advisory group comprises SafeWork NSW, the Anti-Discrimination Board of NSW, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the NSW Women’s Safety Commissioner, Legal Aid NSW, the NSW Police Force, the NSW Public Service Commissioner, Full Stop Australia, the Australian Institute of Health and Safety, the Australian Industry Group, Unions NSW, Out Watch, Muslim Women Australia and Professor Rae Cooper, AO.

Businesses and workers can refer to the NSW Government for resources on how to help prevent sexual harassment in their workplaces and what they can do if they experience workplace sexual harassment. Minister for Industrial Relations and Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis said the prevalence of sexual harassment in Australian workplaces is concerning and added that the collaboration between the NSW Respect at Work programs will help reduce this. “My expectation is that we listen to the feedback from the experts,” Cotsis said.

Minister for Prevention of Domestic Violence and Assault Jodie Harrison said workplace sexual harassment can have a profound impact on individuals and undermine workplace productivity. “The establishment of the NSW Respect at Work Advisory Group is an important step in reducing the prevalence of workplace sexual harassment and making sure people can feel safe at work,” Harrison said.

32,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Resources Safety and Health Queensland (RSHQ) has urged mine sites to be more hands on, to prevent one of the industry’s most common incidents. Since the beginning of 2023, there have been 55 serious incidents reported at Queensland coalmines, with 28 of those incidents involving fingers. RSHQ’s Chief Inspector of Coal Mines, Jacques le Roux, said that although these injuries are not life-threatening, they have a serious impact on the lives of workers. “Because hands are complex body parts, they don’t always perform the same way, or as well, after they have been seriously injured, even after rehabilitation. It’s just not good enough, especially when we know these injuries are preventable,” le Roux said.

A coalmine worker in the Bowen Basin had his finger partially amputated in an incident on 24 August 2023; the incident occurred when a drill rig operator mistakenly thought their co-worker’s hands were clear before starting equipment. The finger was recovered and taken with the patient to Moranbah hospital.

According to RSHQ, more than half of the serious incidents at Queensland coalmines in 2023 have involved fingers; a quarter of the reported serious incidents with fingers involve considerable risk activities associated with lifting, slinging and towing. “Hands are often the body part nearest to a hazard, so risk controls need to focus on lowering the exposure of hands to hazards that can cause serious injury,” le Roux said.

RSHQ has encouraged each site to implement a “hands free” work initiative that involves using machinery and appropriate tools where possible to reduce the need for hands around pinch and crush points. RSHQ also recommends that sites review and monitor their management processes, manning requirements for tasks and lifting procedures.

33,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A new campaign has been launched for Christmas 2023 to combat the rising incidents of abuse and violence against retail workers, and to demonstrate a fresh shared commitment to an industry-wide approach on worker safety and retail crime. The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA), the National Retail Association (NRA) and the Shopping Centre Council of Australia (SCCA) have extended a plea to the wider community to “treat workers with dignity and respect”.

SCCA members will run the SDA’s ‘No One Deserves a Serve’ campaign ads for free nationally across digital media within shopping centres, and workers across small and large retailers will be encouraged to report all incidents of abuse, violence and retail crime to police.

The campaign, first launched by the SDA in 2017, encourages customers to treat retail workers with courtesy and respect. The new Christmas 2023 campaign will be run across more than 3100 digital screens, in 150 shopping centres, home to over 28,000 retailers, from November through the busy Christmas trading period, for maximum in-centre exposure to an estimated 190 million consumer visits across the peak annual shopping period.

In partnering to roll out the Christmas 2023 campaign, the SDA, NRA and SCCA have also made a shared commitment to work together and partner with governments to address the issue of abuse and violence towards workers and rising retail crime. This partnership will address four key pillars:

Ensuring that retail and fast-food workers and retailers report incidents of abuse and violence and retail crime to police. The need for governments to review deterrence and enforcement policies particularly in relation to potential and recidivist offenders, and aggravated assault. Ensuring technology can be used in an appropriate manner to deter offenders, prevent abuse, violence and crime, and to assist law enforcement. Enhanced information sharing and collaboration between retailers, shopping centres and government agencies to improve community safety.

Gerard Dwyer, National Secretary of the SDA, said customer abuse and violence is a serious workplace health and safety issue for retail workers across Australia. “Retail workers are under more stress and pressure during the Christmas season — we’re asking all shoppers not to take out their festive frustrations on the workers who are there to help make your shopping experience a pleasant one,” Dwyer said.

Lindsay Carroll, Deputy CEO of the NRA, said it is critical to demonstrate to offenders that they ‘are not welcome’ if they intend to abuse, assault or harm anyone. “We as an industry are jointly calling for policy reforms to clearly demonstrate that any abuse towards retail employees will not be tolerated,” Carroll said.

34,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has published a Decision Regulation Impact Statement (Decision RIS) about the prohibition of the use of engineered stone. The Decision RIS was developed at the request of WHS ministers and was informed by stakeholder consultation, independent economic analysis and an expert review of evidence. The Decision RIS recommends a prohibition on the use of all engineered stone, irrespective of crystalline silica content, to protect the health and safety of workers.

The recommendation for a prohibition is based on a range of considerations, including the fact that engineered stone workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica (RCS) are over-represented in silicosis cases and are being diagnosed with silicosis at a much younger age than workers from other industries. Engineered stone is also physically and chemically different to natural stone — the high levels of RCS generated by working with engineered stone, as well as the differing properties of this RCS, are likely to contribute to more rapid and severe diseases.

Safe Work Australia reports that there is also no toxicological evidence of a ‘safe’ threshold of a crystalline silica content in engineered stone, or that other chemicals found in engineered stone do not pose a health risk to workers. While silicosis and silica-related diseases are preventable, a persistent lack of compliance with, and enforcement of, the obligations imposed under WHS laws across the engineered stone industry have failed to protect workers from the health risks associated with RCS.

The Decision RIS was provided to Commonwealth, state and territory work health and safety (WHS) ministers on 16 August 2023 for their consideration. While the ministers have not made a decision on the recommendation in the Decision RIS to prohibit the use of all engineered stone, they have agreed that Safe Work Australia should publish the Decision RIS ahead of their decision.

The Decision RIS builds on the evidence and analysis considered by WHS ministers in the Decision Regulation Impact Statement: Managing the risks of respirable crystalline silica at work. The timing of a decision by WHS ministers on the prohibition of the use of engineered stone is a matter for government. Information about meetings of WHS ministers can be found on the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations website.

35,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Employers and community members in Victoria have been encouraged to provide feedback on how the state government can boost women’s participation and advancement in the manufacturing and energy industries. Minister for Women Natalie Hutchins welcomed the release of a discussion paper that is a key part of the Victorian Government’s response to the Inquiry into Economic Equity for Victorian Women. The discussion paper outlines some of the primary reasons why women continue to be under-represented in male-dominated industries like manufacturing, where women only make up 31% of the workforce, and identifies how industry-specific initiatives are needed to address this.

The discussion paper seeks views on how workplaces can increase support and create safe work environments for women from diverse backgrounds, in recognition of the issue that some groups of women face additional barriers to participation and career advancement. The discussion paper follows previous industry consultation and features questions about key aspects of the strategies, such as the proposed scope, vision, outcomes and priority action areas.

The release of the discussion paper follows the Victorian Government’s announcement of $840,000 to support four organisations to help women advance to more senior positions, promote respectful culture at work and encourage students to take up careers in energy or manufacturing. The programs delivered by the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union, the National Association of Women in Operations, Victorian Trades Hall Council and Australian Women in Solar Energy are all part of a $2.7 million investment to increase women’s participation in the energy and manufacturing industries.

Minister for Women Natalie Hutchins said she looks forward to hearing from both industries about how the government can support more women to carve out successful careers in these industries. “Increasing women’s participation in male-dominated industries, especially in trade-based and leadership roles, will help women fully contribute to our state’s economy, towards a more equal state. We’re supporting these industries to not only address barriers, attract and retain more women employees, but also provide opportunities for women to thrive,” Hutchins said.

Written submissions to the discussion paper can be submitted here until Thursday, 30 November.

36,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A study conducted by Monash University will partner with people who have lived experience of a workers compensation claim to design better systems. The study, led by Professor Alex Collie from Monash University’s School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, will engage workers with physical and psychological injury and illness, and their support networks.

Each year, more than half a million Australians are injured or become ill at work; 31% of them make a workers compensation claim, resulting in at least 1.9 million weeks of lost work costing the economy $28.6 billion each year. Each state and territory in Australia has a workers compensation scheme. There are also three national schemes for Commonwealth government workers, Defence Force personnel and maritime workers.

Collie said there is evidence that Australia’s workers compensation systems are structured and operated in a way that could cause problems for injured workers, with many studies in Australia and internationally indicating that people find workers compensation stressful and complex — for some people, this can contribute to slower recovery and distress. “These studies suggest that it is the way workers compensation schemes operate that can lead to problems. The sector has a history of treating injured workers as claims to be managed, rather than as vulnerable people in need of support,” Collie said.

Workers’ Voice: Harnessing lived experience to redesign Australia’s workers’ compensation systems, will work with workers and their supporters to design a workers compensation system that reflects their experiences, views and preferences. “We think that workers with an injury or illness, their family and friends have a unique and very valuable experience of workers compensation. This experience should be heard and have greater weight in the way systems are designed and the way they operate,” Collie said.

Using a technique called participatory system modelling, the researchers will develop and test new design and delivery approaches, with the results used to provide a vision for a new approach to workers compensation that supports the recovery and return to work of Australians with work-related injury or illness. Collie said that most of Australia’s workers compensation schemes were designed in the 1980s, but the world of work and the types of injury and illness seen at work have changed fundamentally. “Because workers haven’t been involved in designing compensation schemes before, we don’t really know what solutions will be developed. That is a really exciting part of this project,” Collie said.

The study involves the Australian Centre for Justice Innovation, the University of Melbourne and the University of Waterloo, as well as injured worker support groups and networks around Australia. Collie believes that governments will listen to the study findings.

“Some of our largest workers compensation schemes have been under enormous financial pressure, and are struggling to get people back to work. To manage their budgets, governments have been cutting benefits and restricting access to these schemes. This short-term, knee-jerk reaction to financial pressure creates as many problems as it solves. A better way to improve a system and make it sustainable is to listen carefully to people with direct experience of that system. The Workers’ Voice Project provides an opportunity to do just that,” Collie said.

The Workers’ Voice Project will run until 2026, with major findings released periodically from 2024.

40,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"SafeWork NSW has launched a four-year Strategy (2023–2027) to support businesses across the state in preventing workplace sexual harassment and other gender-based harmful workplace behaviours. Through the Strategy, SafeWork NSW will educate NSW businesses on their duties to prevent and respond to workplace sexual harassment before it occurs and take appropriate enforcement action to protect workers.

The Strategy will be led by the SafeWork NSW Respect at Work Taskforce, reportedly one of the first Australian WHS regulators to establish a dedicated team focused on addressing gender-based harmful workplace behaviours. SafeWork NSW consulted over 60 stakeholders including worker, union, government and businesses representatives across 18 industries, who provided insights to inform the Strategy.

The Strategy features a dedicated NSW Government website with resources for workers and businesses on how they can help prevent sexual harassment in their workplaces and what they can do if they experience workplace sexual harassment. The SafeWork NSW Respect at Work Taskforce and NSW Government’s Centre for Work Health and Safety have also invested in research on evidence-based and prevention-led interventions to address workplace sexual harassment. The research project is a collaboration between the Respect at Work Taskforce, the Centre for Work Health and Safety, RMIT University and the University of Newcastle.

Head of SafeWork NSW Trent Curtin said workplace sexual harassment is unacceptably common, with one in three Australians in the past five years reporting experiencing it, and affecting 41% of women and 26% of men. “Everyone deserves to have a workplace which is free from bullying, harassment and all forms of discrimination. Through this Strategy, SafeWork NSW will help equip NSW businesses to create safer and respectful workplaces,” Curtin said.

41,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"SafeWork NSW has fined food delivery company Fantuan for failing to adequately train more than 1000 food delivery riders in hazard and fatigue management, road safety, the use of PPE and work health and safety duties and obligations. This comes after the NSW Government's introduction of a bill to parliament that, if passed, could lead to increased penalties for non-compliance with work health and safety regulations.

Inspectors from SafeWork NSW met with representatives from Fantuan to discuss rider safety trends identified in recent compliance activities and assess Fantuan’s compliance with Part 4.11 of the Work Health and Safety Regulation 2017. Under 4.11 of the WHS regulations, platforms must supply high-vis personal protective equipment to food delivery riders (FDRs), provide food delivery induction training to FDRs and ensure FDRs have successfully completed training.

Fantuan was recently issued with a number of improvement notices in relation to the induction training provided to food delivery workers not being adequate or completed, and failing to keep records of training in accordance with regulations. Fantuan was also issued with four penalty notices worth $13,600. SafeWork will follow up with Fantuan on the matter and failure to comply with any future improvement notice could result in a penalty of up to $332,611 for the corporation.

There have been eight fatalities involving FDRs in NSW since January 2018, with two of those fatalities occurring in 2023. Minister for Industrial Relations and Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis said SafeWork inspectors will be meeting with other food delivery platforms, with more fines and penalties coming for platforms who can’t demonstrate that they’ve met these requirements.

“We have put the onus on food delivery platforms to ensure the riders they engage are trained properly and have systems in place that ensure riders are trained and this is recorded. This is a message to other food delivery companies who don’t follow the rules — you are on notice,” Cotsis said.

The workplace safety penalties were previously frozen for nearly 10 years. Despite the national ban on the manufacture, use and importation of asbestos coming into force in 2004, asbestos still continues to make its way into NSW workplaces.

The new laws will increase every court penalty imposed in NSW relating to unsafe workplaces, increase maximum fines from $798,383 to $2,168,029 and the maximum imprisonment time from five years to 10 years, for the worst offences under the Work Health and Safety (WHS) Laws, known as Category 1 offences. Under the new laws, SafeWork NSW will be able to issue a ‘prohibited asbestos notice’ to direct people and employers to take safety measures to remove and manage asbestos in the workplace. These amendments will enable the work health and safety regulator to ensure that prohibited asbestos is removed permanently from workplaces.

The new laws will also stop employers gaming WHS laws by banning the use of insurance to pay for WHS fines as a ‘cost of doing business’. A silica register will also be established, to track and trace exposed workers and enable early intervention and better healthcare research. The silica register is one part of a comprehensive response by the NSW Government, which includes increased silicosis screening, worker education and industry compliance blitzes, while the Commonwealth process nears completion.

43,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Resources Safety and Health Queensland (RSHQ) has issued a reminder for safety officers at mine sites to effectively manage heat exposure and to protect workers from heat-related illnesses, as the country enters an El Niño weather event. El Niño increases the risk of extreme temperature shifts, like heatwaves and hotter days.

Thermal conditions and risk factors in mines can change frequently, with all mine workers responding to heat in different ways. These factors must be considered when assessing heat exposure risks. RSHQ Chief Operating Officer Rob Djukic said the strategies and techniques used to reduce heat stress at mines are simple, but often overlooked. “That includes modifying the environment to suit the work, modifying the work to suit the environment, or sometimes a combination of both. Safety at Queensland mines is everyone’s responsibility and we’re here to assist the mines to ensure all workers feel safe,” Djukic said.

Mine sites should consider implementing a range of measures to reduce heat-related illnesses, including reducing radiant heat sources using insulation, spot cooling or shielding, and implementing regular rest breaks in cool areas such as vehicle cabins, crib rooms and control rooms. Potable water and ice machines should be within easy access for workers to hydrate regularly, with work activities planned to include periods of acclimatisation for workers returning after prolonged absence.

Mine sites should also provide portable shades as refuge areas for temporary or remote work locations, and increase air movement by installing mechanical fans and cooling fans where possible. Mechanical aids should also be used where possible, to minimise physical exertion in heat. To further reduce the risk of workers suffering heat-related illnesses, high physical work activities should be rescheduled to cooler times during the shift. Workers are also advised to select clothing options that offer ventilation openings and permeable fabric.

Dean Banks, Chief Executive Officer of Ventia Group, said the company is proud to continue its partnership with the OFSC to support the industry with resources that will keep people and communities safe. Banks added that the Heavy Metal safety program supports the company’s ongoing commitment to elevating safety standards across the industry.

“At Ventia, ensuring the safety and health of our people, clients and communities is the fundamental guiding principle for everything we do — it is our licence to operate. As employers, we should embrace innovative and strategic thinking to find effective solutions which eliminate the need for mobile plant and people interfaces. Where this is not possible, we must look for the safest and most efficient plant for the job and apply the ‘hierarchy of controls’ to prioritise the separation of people from plant. It is everyone’s responsibility to be vigilant and keep themselves and others a safe operational distance from plant. We should be aware when ‘Heavy Metal’ is nearby and always adhere to designated exclusion zones,” Banks said.

The safety campaign features a range of resources, including site posters, toolbox talks and a series of interactive 360° blind spot micro e-learnings showing the different operator visibility (blind spots) in excavators, articulated dump trucks, skidsteers and rollers.

“October is National Safe Work Month. In collaboration with Ventia, the OFSC is pleased to be launching practical resources to help builders and workers that work with mobile plant to get home safely every day,” said Federal Safety Commissioner David Denney.

45,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Australian Government has made changes to the national road vehicle standards to provide safer trucks in Australia, thereby helping to reduce road trauma while bolstering freight productivity. The Safer Freight Vehicles package includes an increase to the overall width limit from 2.50 to 2.55 metres for new trucks that are fitted with a number of safety features.

The safety features include devices to reduce blind spots, electronic stability control, advanced emergency braking, a lane departure warning system, better reflective markings, and side guards to stop pedestrians and cyclists from being caught up under the rear wheels of trucks. Trucks fitted with these safety features could save lives and prevent serious injuries to vehicle occupants, cyclists and pedestrians.

Allowing wider trucks on the road will also reduce the number of road freight trips taken by businesses, saving money and lowering their environmental impact. Many of the safety devices and sensors will be able to be fitted to the trucks without counting towards the width and length measurements. This includes front and kerb view mirrors to better see around the front-left corner of the vehicle, external parts of camera monitor systems for improved indirect vision, blind spot sensors, and cross-view mirrors to see in front of bonneted vehicles. This will help ensure manufacturers and owners are not disadvantaged by fitting trucks with these features.

While the overall width limit for buses and trailers won’t change, they will benefit from more safety devices being excluded from width and length measurements. This change will allow manufacturers to design and supply these safer trucks in Australia, though operators should continue to engage with their registration authority to determine whether road access permits are required.

The changes under the Safe Freight Vehicles package came into effect on 1 October 2023, and are forecast to provide a net benefit of over $500 million to the Australian economy.

Federal Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Carol Brown said the Safer Freight Vehicles package responds to the calls from industry to increase the width limit of trucks and follows extensive consultation and feedback. Brown expects that the changes will be a game changer for the industry, businesses and other road users, as they will save lives by adopting technology to reduce the likelihood of crashes.

“Our truckies play a vital role in the Australian economy and our day-to-day lives, ensuring we can access the food, medicines and other goods we need. Today’s announcement will mean they can carry out their work more safely and efficiently, so they and those they share the road with can get home safe at the end of each trip,” Brown said.

The Safer Freight Vehicles package includes an increase to the overall width limit from 2.50 to 2.55 metres for new trucks that are fitted with a number of safety features.
Trucks fitted with these safety features could save lives and prevent serious injuries to vehicle occupants, cyclists and pedestrians.
Allowing wider trucks on the road will also reduce the number of road freight trips taken by businesses, saving money and lowering their environmental impact.

46,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Everyone involved with dangerous goods in Road Transportation, Logistics, Warehousing and Stevedoring is responsible for understanding their requirements to ensure that they are transported, handled and stored safely. Australian Standard AS1940 The Storage and Handling of Flammable and Combustible Liquids sets out the requirements and recommendations as classified by the UN Model Recommendations and listed in the Australian Dangerous Goods Code (ADG Code) which covers these goods as transported in packages, intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) and bulk.

The Australian Dangerous Goods Code (ADG Code) Edition 7.8 sets out specific duties for the Road Transportation, Logistics, Warehousing and Stevedoring of Dangerous Goods. Failure to comply with regulations made under the ADG Code is an offence.

The ADG Code, governing both road and rail transport, defines Dangerous Goods including gases, flammable liquids and substances, oxidizing substances and organic peroxides, toxic and infectious substances, corrosive substances and miscellaneous environmentally hazardous material. These goods are classified according to their effects such as fire, pollution, corrosion, oxidation, spontaneous combustion or poisoning which may result in bodily injury, property damage, or environmental impairment or damage, or a combination of all three.

The updated version of the Australian Dangerous Goods Code Edition 7.8 came into effect 1 April 2023 and will bring domestic regulations in line with international provisions with the focus on improving transportation, storage and handling of dangerous goods safety outcomes. There is a 12-month transition period in place where both edition 7.7 and edition 7.8 can be used. The ADG Code is given legal force in each Australian State and Territory by each jurisdiction’s dangerous goods transport laws and includes vital information such as supply chain duties and licence requirements. ADG Code 7.8 will be mandatory from 1 April 2024.

The newly released AR Interactive – Warehouse & Logistics Managers Guide to Workplace Safety 2023, produced in conjunction with National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (NHVR), Supply Chain & Logistics Association of Australia (SCLAA), Australian Logistics Council (ALC), Healthy Heads Trucks & Sheds (HHTS) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation, provides an overview of the relevant regulatory framework and updated ADG Code 7.8, how this aligns with the Heavy Vehicle National Law (HVNL) and the obligations of parties in the Chain of Responsibility (CoR).

47,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Government of Western Australia has released a suite of tools to help WA mining companies create safer workplaces for women, as part of the Respect in Mining program. The Respect in Mining program is designed to support small and medium mining organisations to increase awareness and knowledge of the gendered drivers of violence, the impact of gender inequality on women’s safety and economic security, and the impact of gendered division in leadership and decision-making. The launch of the toolkit complements the start of National Safe Work Month in October.

The program’s tools and resources provide guidance to mining companies on how to set clear standards and procedures for expectations of behaviour, and identify and appropriately respond to incidents of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace.

Developed by Curtin University’s Collaboration for Evidence, Research and Impact in Public Health, the Respect in Mining toolkit will be available sector-wide. It provides organisations with 19 tools and resources that can be adapted to their workplace, including guidance on how to gain leadership support and commitment, guidance on dealing with backlash and resistance, and procedures and guidance on how to review and improve practice. The resources also include a template to develop a sexual harassment and sexual assault policy, and assessment and audit tools to identify culture or risk of sexual harassment and sexual assault. An implementation guide provides direction on how to put the tools and resources into practice and monitor the overall shift in workplace culture.

Gold Fields Australia will participate in a 12-month pilot of the Respect in Mining program across its WA operations, scheduled to begin in early 2024. The Respect in Mining program is based on the principles of the Department of Communities’ Respectful Relationships programs and is an initiative of the Mental Awareness, Respect and Safety program. It is part of a strategy to eliminate unacceptable behaviour in the mining and resources sector, alongside the SPEAK UP, REPORT IT campaign and WorkSafe WA’s 24/7 hotline (1800 678 198), launched in August.

Women’s Interests Minister Sue Ellery said workplace sexual harassment is not a women’s issue, but a societal issue that all organisations, employers and individuals have a responsibility to address. “The toolkit and the Respect in Mining program is one of many initiatives being undertaken by the Cook government that highlights our commitment to ensuring the Western Australian resources sector offers a friendly, accommodating and empowering workplace for women. We need to encourage more women to join the resources sector by treating them with respect, ensuring their safety and providing support,” Ellery said.

Industrial Relations Minister Bill Johnston said everyone has a responsibility to speak out against sexual harassment and other unacceptable workplace behaviours. “The Respect in Mining toolkit will be available sector-wide and will help create safer workplaces for women in Western Australia. While the mining and resources sector has begun its journey to change workplace culture, the Cook government acknowledges there is still much more to be done,” Johnston said.

48,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has released the Key Work Health and Safety Statistics Australia 2023 report, providing a national snapshot of work health and safety. The report revealed that in 2022, 195 people were fatally injured at work in Australia, compared with 172 in 2021. Overall, the number and rate of fatalities has been trending downwards since 2007. The rate of serious workers compensation claims was 6.5 serious claims per million hours worked in 2021–22.

Safe Work Australia CEO Michelle Baxter said that while the trends are encouraging, the statistics are still too high, with a lot more work needed to ensure that everyone gets home safely. “We know that work-related fatalities, injuries and disease have a devastating impact on workers and their families. This report brings together key data that will help inform improved WHS policy and practice to make Australian workplaces safer and heathier,” Baxter said.

The report provides a high-level overview of national statistics on work-related fatalities, injuries and disease. The traumatic injury fatality rate for workers in Australia has reportedly decreased by 30% since 2012. Of the 195 worker fatalities in 2022, 93% were male, and 42% involved a vehicle. Machinery operators and drivers had the highest number of fatalities by occupation (74 fatalities). The agriculture, forestry and fishing industry had the highest worker fatality rate (14.7 per 100,000).

The report revealed that there were 127,800 serious workers compensation claims in Australia. Body stressing was the leading cause of serious workers compensation claims (32.6%), while mental health conditions accounted for 9.2% or 11,700 claims in 2021–22. This figure is higher than 10 years ago, rising from 6.5% of all serious claims in 2011–12 to 9.2% in 2021–22. Accepted serious workers compensation claims for COVID-19 have also increased from the previous year, from 400 in 2020–21 to 9400 in 2021–22. The age group with the lowest frequency rate continued to be workers aged 35–44 years, at 5.4 serious claims per million hours worked.

50,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"WorkSafe Victoria and SafeWork NSW have visited 22 building sites in Yarrawonga and Mulwala as part of a joint agency operation to boost construction safety. The safety blitz from 21–25 August focused on the risks associated with working at height and exposure to crystalline silica dust, but inspectors also kept an eye out for general workplace safety issues. The site inspections are a key element of the Cross Border Construction Program, which aims to help local construction businesses along the Victoria–NSW border comply with workplace health and safety requirements.

WorkSafe inspectors issued 17 improvement notices during seven workplace visits and observed two safety issues that were remedied on the spot. Electrical risks were the most common concern with five improvement notices issued, followed by a lack of secure fencing (three). Notices were also issued for working at height without fall control measures in place, incomplete scaffolds, poor housekeeping, performing high-risk construction work not in accordance with a Safe Work Method Statement, and failing to have a Crystalline Silica Hazard Control Statement for tasks that exposed workers to crystalline silica dust.

Director of Construction and Earth Resources Matt Wielgosz said WorkSafe is committed to making safety the top priority at all construction sites, adding that proactive site visits can help prevent tragedies that were otherwise waiting to happen. “As the results show, there is much room for improvement. Together with SafeWork, we’ll continue to help employers understand and meet their health and safety obligations,” Wielgosz said.

SafeWork NSW Executive Director Matt Press said inspectors are taking a zero-tolerance approach to unsafe practices, as falls from heights are the number one killer in the construction industry. Of the 15 sites visited, SafeWork issued one penalty notice and 38 improvement notices in relation to poor site security, non-compliant testing and tagging of electrical equipment, and failure to have a Safe Work Method Statement in place. The inspectors also issued six prohibition notices, including three for working at heights, two for the removal of machine guards and one for the unsafe use of an elevated work platform.

“SafeWork Inspectors also had some very positive interactions with local tradies and discussed safer ways of working, especially around high-risk hazards associated with the movement of vehicles, and safety around moving plant,” Press said.

The body-worn cameras now form part of an inspector’s operational equipment during worksite visits or while undertaking compliance and investigation activities. The use of the cameras brings SafeWork SA in line with similar agencies and helps support the safety of inspectors by encouraging safe and mutually respectful interactions.

The cameras will also reduce disputes and enable complaints to be easily investigated and resolved by reviewing relevant footage. The cameras support transparency and accountability for inspectors while administering their duties and exercising their powers. The body-worn cameras can be fitted to the front of inspectors’ uniforms and will be clearly visible during an interaction. The footage captured by the camera will assist inspectors with their enquiries and investigations involving workplace incidents.

Inspectors have been trained in the use of the cameras and they will advise the person(s) of the presence of the camera and the intention to record video and audio of their actions and conversations. The recordings will be stored in a secure evidence management system with controlled access.

SafeWork SA Executive Director Glenn Farrell said the vision and audio recorded by the cameras will help strengthen the agency’s investigation capabilities. “The use of body-worn cameras is an extension to our inspectors’ function of monitoring and securing compliance as well as increasing their personal safety by encouraging civil interactions,” Farrell said.

52,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"As part of its Injury Risk Reduction Initiatives program, WorkCover Queensland has funded a project to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injuries sustained by plumbers, in collaboration with the Master Plumbers’ Association of Queensland (MPAQ).

WorkCover Queensland Head of Partnerships Sharon Stratford said reducing musculoskeletal injury risk in the construction industry is a clear way to support workplaces to be safer. According to Stratford, muscular stress and handling objects caused around 40% of construction industry WorkCover claims in 2021–2022.

“Around 60% of these claims involved the injured workers having to take time off work, resulting in disruption to their lives, as well as to their workplaces. We identified there was real potential here to collaborate with others to make a difference in the industry,” Stratford said.

The initiative focused on robust risk controls, including consultative work design and development of engineering solutions. WorkCover and MPAQ worked with industry employers CC Group and Beavis and Bartels Group, as well as occupational health physiotherapists to identify specific concerns regarding hazardous manual tasks and musculoskeletal injuries. The initiative aimed to promote appropriate control measures and materials to educate workers on how to apply a risk assessment approach to hazardous manual tasks onsite.

Following a series of worksite visits and engagement with a range of workers, a series of ‘Own safety onsite’ toolbox talks and materials were developed to help plumbers take ownership of their health and wellbeing by using a hierarchical approach to hazard control onsite. This included using and promoting higher order controls, such as lifting aides and engineering controls, to reduce the manual task risk to workers. Lower order controls, such as technique-based lifting advice, team lifting protocols and pre-start warm-ups, were also included where higher order controls are not practicable. Training was provided to project managers on manual task risk management and leading toolbox talks and exercise sessions relating to physical demands of jobs.

A post-training survey of the project managers found that 100% of managers were satisfied with the training received and believed the resources were well suited, while 100% felt confident to deliver the developed content in toolbox talks. The survey also found that 93% of participants believed the project will reduce injury risk among plumbers; however, 100% said they would recommend this project to other employers in their industry.

MPAQ Executive Director Penny Cornah said the pilot initiative showcases the significance of collaboration efforts between WorkCover, MPAQ and their members, enabling active participation and delivering tangible benefits.

The toolbox talk resources will soon be shared more broadly in Queensland’s plumbing industry, so that other workers and businesses can use these in their own workplaces and benefit from the tested approach.

With the tragic bushfires of 2019–2020 still fresh in the minds of all, the NSW Government has launched an online, interactive SeasonalSAFE planning tool to help businesses prepare and manage the risks that summer weather can pose to their workers and patrons.

After completing the simple SeasonalSAFE Plan form, a business is provided with a tailored list containing a number of actions that must be carried out to ensure the business is keeping to its plan. All businesses are urged to complete a SeasonalSAFE Plan — this includes businesses in Sydney’s CBD where bushfire-related dangers can often be neglected. While the flames themselves may not be a threat to these businesses, smoke from the fires can often travel thousands of kilometres, polluting the lungs of those in the city.

During the four and a half months of continuous bushfires in 2019–2020, authorities indicated there were more deaths resulting from smoke than bushfires. The SeasonalSAFE Plan can be accessed on the SeasonalSAFE page.

Head of SafeWork NSW Natasha Mann said the bushfires of 2019–2020 were a catastrophe, with the fire ground in NSW covering 7% of the state in February 2020. “Employers have a responsibility to their workers and customers to keep them safe this summer, and the SeasonalSAFE Plan is the perfect way to get the ball rolling on how you can best ensure they are both protected from the heat and everything that comes with it,” Mann said.

The $340,000 investment will fund employment service providers such as Fitted for Work to deliver Project Purple, which enables transgender, non-binary and gender-diverse Victorians to have more access to employment opportunities. Funding to the Pride Centre will also connect LGBTIQ+ jobseekers with Jobs Victoria Partners and other employment service providers.

Michelle Sheppard, an advocate in the gender equity space, said inclusion of LGBTIQ+ employees remains inconsistent, as transgender jobseekers face discrimination, with an unemployment rate three times the national average. “Despite advancements, two-thirds of LGBTIQ+ employees still hide their identities at work. This impacts their wellbeing, satisfaction, productivity, talent retention and leadership growth,” Sheppard said.

The Pride Centre is a resource and ideas hub for LGBTIQ+ groups and organisations. Since opening its doors in 2022, the Pride Centre has attracted 17,000 visitors and houses 16 organisations. Fitted for Work supports women, non-binary and gender diverse people to become job-ready and gain secure employment. The not-for-profit organisation provides a range of work-readiness services including job search workshops, one-on-one interview preparation, and a personal outfitting service that helps people to access work-appropriate clothing.

Fitted for Work Managing Director Donna de Zwart said the finding represents a milestone in the organisation’s commitment to fostering inclusivity and diversity within the employment sector. Justine Dalla Riva, Chief Executive Officer of the Victorian Pride Centre, said the funding is an exciting opportunity for the organisation to present a series of events and activations that foster an environment of connection and support for LGBTIQ+ people seeking employment services.

“Everyone deserves a fair go when they're looking for work, and LGBTIQ+ people in our community face higher levels of discrimination than other Victorians — we’re proud to support organisations that are levelling the playing field,” Ben Carroll, Minister for Employment, said.

55,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Experts from the University of South Australia have called for the nation’s employment laws and regulations to be updated so they reflect the changing nature of work, as many people continue to work from home long after the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr Ruchi Sinha, Associate Professor of Organisational Behaviour, said labour laws and protections should be updated to clarify issues related to work hours, overtime and breaks in a remote work context, now that almost half of all employees are working from home at least once a week.

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report on the welfare and wellbeing of Australians found that prior to the pandemic, 13% of people aged 18 and over with a job reported working from home most days. By April 2022, 46% of people had worked from home at least once per week in the previous four weeks.

Sinha said the changing nature of work has brought about a need to ensure remote workers have access to the same employment protections as in-office workers and are provided the same training and development and health and wellbeing opportunities.

“We need to ensure that remote work policies are inclusive and provide reasonable accommodations for employees, including employees with disabilities. Employers should be promoting the adoption of technologies that enable people to work from home, this includes essential equipment like laptops, webcams and audio tools. Such investment in digital infrastructure and resources for remote workers should be encouraged in rural areas too, to reduce digital poverty,” Sinha said.

Other findings in the AIHW report included life satisfaction, psychological distress and loneliness among Australians. The report found that although people’s satisfaction with life in general has shown recovery since the pandemic, it has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, with the average life satisfaction in August 2023 recorded at 6.6 out of 10, compared to 7.5 in 2019. The proportion of adults experiencing psychological distress has also failed to return to pre-pandemic levels, with 12.9% of adults reporting severe psychological distress, compared to 8.4% in 2017. Almost 40% of Australians also reported experiencing loneliness recently.

Sinha said employers can play an important role in promoting health and wellbeing in peoples’ lives, particularly if employees are working from home. Sinha urged employers to recognise the potential challenges of remote work on mental health, and to establish policies that promote wellbeing, such as regular check-ins between managers and remote workers, and providing access to mental health resources and support.

“It’s important too to balance remote and in-office work by considering hybrid work models that meet the needs of both employees and employers. Things like face-to-face events and meetings arranged at cafes and restaurants can help with loneliness as well as culture building,” Sinha said.

56,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The federal government has introduced its Closing Loopholes Bill in the parliament to support Australian workers by closing loopholes that undercut pay and conditions. In 2022, the Secure Jobs, Better Pay legislation was enacted to improve working conditions and initiate wage growth. The four major elements of the Closing Loopholes Bill are criminalising wage theft; closing the forced permanent casual worker loophole; closing the labour hire loophole; and introducing minimum standards for workers in the gig economy.

The introduction of this Bill follows months of consultations, including with employer groups and unions. The Closing Loopholes Bill also aims to allow the Fair Work Commission to set minimum standards for the road transport industry. Other elements of the Bill include continuing to implement the Boland Review to introduce an offence for industrial manslaughter and increase penalties. The Bill also aims to provide better support to first responders diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, stronger workplace protections for survivors of family or domestic violence, and better representation for safety and compliance issues in the workplace by expanding the powers of the Fair Work Commission to permit right of entry to investigate suspected underpayments.

The Bill will also expand the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to include silica safety and silica-related diseases, and provide specific protections for delegates, such as greater legal powers to challenge unfair contract terms. These measures are designed to close loopholes that have undercut secure jobs, better pay and safe workplaces.

However, some industry leaders, such as the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA), have characterised these changes as extreme and interventionist, with potential negative consequences. A statement issued by the organisation said the government’s industrial relations changes are fundamentally flawed and will further damage productivity and compound the cost of living pressures on households. The MCA has called on the government to scrap the legislation in its entirety.

“Every business will be captured by this dramatic change to industrial relations, till they fight their way out through a myriad of complex, arduous and slow legal processes, with the Fair Work Commission acting as the only umpire,” Tania Constable, Chief Executive Officer of the MCA, said.

Jennifer Westacott, Chief Executive of Business Council Australia, said the government’s changes to workplace relations as set out in the Bill will impact every worker, contractor and business at a time of rising economic uncertainty and a cost of living crisis.

“While the BCA has been supportive of minimum standards to protect gig workers, we have argued that those protections should be in legislation and not left to the Fair Work Commission. What we are seeing through this legislation is a massive increase in power back to an outdated centralised model of wage setting. Many of the decisions will now be out of the hands of businesses, employees and the legislature, and in the hands of overstretched, unelected officials at the Fair Work Commission leading to delay, cost and confusion,” Westacott said.

57,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"New regulations under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (SA) will help provide better guidance to workers and employers on how to manage the risk of psychological injuries and illnesses in the workplace. Psychological illnesses have a significant effect on workers’ health, as well as business productivity. There has been a growing recognition of the need for the work health and safety framework to better deal with risks of psychological harm.

The new regulations reflect the outcomes of an independent review of Australia’s model work health and safety laws in 2018, which recommended more specific guidance on how to identify and manage psychological risks. The new regulations will come into effect in December 2023.

Psychosocial hazards are hazards that may cause psychological harm. Examples range from excessive workload demands to issues such as bullying, harassment and sexual discrimination in the workplace. When the regulations come into effect they will be supported by a code of practice on managing psychosocial hazards at work, developed in consultation with workers and businesses.

SafeWork SA Executive Director Glenn Farrell said the new regulations and code of practice will support businesses to be proactive in ensuring their workers are free from harm at work. “SafeWork SA will be working with employer and employee organisations to push out guidance material to [help] business owners understand their obligations,” Farrell said.

Minister for Industrial Relations and Public Sector Kyam Maher said preventing psychological harm is essential for creating a safe and healthy workplace. “These new regulations are part of a significant national effort to better address the risks caused by psychosocial hazards at work and recognise that a worker’s psychological health is just as important as their physical health,” Maher said.

58,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Recent findings suggest the prevalence of poor mental health in the mining industry is high and the risk of psychological distress in remote mining was significantly higher among workers aged 44 years or under and has increased in the past six years compared to all other industries.1. 2. 3.

There are a number of mental health problems unique to the Mining and Quarry Industry, whose cause is directly influenced by the work involved, examples being the hazardous environment, work organisation (shift work schedules, fly-in fly-out, compressed roster swings), interpersonal relations (work-family conflicts), psychosocial risk at work (high job demand, job stress), wellbeing (quality of life, job satisfaction) and substance abuse. A perceived culture of incivility within a team or worksite is also linked to poorer mental health, as well as a higher frequency and severity of aggressive, bullying or harassment and sexual violence workplace behaviours.

59,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The ‘HEART 5’ mobile health unit that travels around Queensland offering free lung checks for retired and former Queensland mine and quarry workers will be in Mount Isa from 18–20 September 2023. The truck will provide free screening for former workers to help detect mine dust lung diseases like black lung and silicosis. Early detection enables former workers in remote and regional areas to access support and treatment.

HEART 5 is fully equipped with medical equipment to provide a thorough assessment that includes a lung function test and chest X-ray, and when required, follow-up tests such as high-resolution CT scans. The service is operated by Heart of Australia in partnership with the mining industry’s independent regulator Resources Safety and Health Queensland (RSHQ) and the Queensland Government.

Dean Barr, RSHQ’s Executive Director of Occupational Health, said mine dust lung diseases can take up to 10 years or more to develop, and even longer to produce noticeable symptoms. “We know that prevention is the best defence; however, identifying the disease in its early stages can prevent it from progressing to a point where it seriously impacts your quality of life. I strongly urge all former workers to get a free lung check,” Barr said.

Since its launch in February 2022, free checks aboard HEART 5 have detected 57 cases of mine dust lung disease diagnosed in former workers. Bookings are essential and can be made through the Mine Dust Health Support Service by emailing info@minedusthealthsupport.com or calling 1300 445 715.

Applicants must no longer work in the industry and have at least three years’ experience in coalmines, mineral mines or quarries. Former workers are entitled to one free check every five years. Free checks are also available at local RSHQ-approved doctors, and in many cases, RSHQ can cover the travel costs.

60,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Australia Post has urged Australians to keep an eye out for postal workers, after data revealed that a postie is injured by a third party on the roads at least once a week. In the past financial year, 65 postal workers sustained serious injuries as a result of third-party traffic accidents, including broken limbs, concussions and lacerations, with many resulting in hospital stays, time off work and psychological trauma. Across the country, New South Wales recorded the highest number of accidents involving postal workers.

Some of the most common third-party accidents involving posties included drivers not looking when using, or speeding through, roundabouts, failing to stop at a Stop or Give Way sign, driving distracted by a mobile phone or failing to leave enough space to stop safely.

To help protect postal workers, Australia Post has implemented safety measures, including installing telematics (video and data) across thousands of its electric delivery vehicles (eDVs), motorcycles, vans and trucks. High-vis uniforms, intensive road safety training for all posties, sensors and duress buttons on eDVs (which pinpoint the location of a postie in an emergency) are also standard across the network.

Australia Post General Manager (Safety and Wellbeing) Rod Maule said that even one vehicle-related incident is too many, with postal workers often sustaining injuries from being knocked off their vehicle or swerving off the road to avoid a more serious incident from occurring. Maule urged all drivers to be alert and keep an eye out for posties, particularly over the next few months as deliveries increase in the lead-up to Christmas.

“While we want our team to deliver for all Australians, we also want each of them to safely get home to their families at the end of the day. Safety is our number one priority, which is why we’ve invested millions of dollars into advanced technology and training to keep our team safe on the road,” Maule said.","Across the country, New South Wales recorded the highest number of accidents involving postal workers.

61,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Research has found that fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) shift workers are particularly sleep-deprived and at risk of developing sleep disorders. Now, Edith Cowan University (ECU) is investigating what can be done to improve FIFO workers’ wellbeing by conducting a study that looks at where remote workers in the resources industry are sleeping to see how it impacts their quality of sleep.

The ECU researchers are calling for participants to take part in an online survey, where they can also offer to participate in another study in which workers will wear a sleep tracker to bed and have a light/temperature data logger placed nearby.

ECU PhD candidate and lead researcher Philipp Beranek said it is vital to investigate what can be done to improve resources workers’ sleep health.

“Sleep is a paramount physiological state for health and performance while we’re awake. We know resources workers experience sleep difficulties; therefore, investigating modifiable factors which impact sleep is crucial. Our main aim is to investigate the relationship between the sleep environment and the sleep of shift workers in the sector,” Beranek said.

ECU previously conducted a study on the sleeping habits of FIFO shift workers in which 60% of participants were at risk of developing sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea and shift work disorder. Beranek said adequate sleep is especially important in an industry as potentially hazardous as the resources sector, as sleep loss can negatively affect mood, the immune system and cognitive functioning such as attention and memory.

“It can also result in increased risk of workplace accidents, increased absenteeism and reduced job satisfaction and team effectiveness, with financial consequences for employees and employers. The sleep environment has been identified as a crucial element in fatigue risk management and initial studies in other populations indicate sleep environment factors such as light and temperature can negatively impact sleep. To date, no study has investigated the sleep environment and its influence on the sleep of shift workers in extractive industries; our study is designed to close this gap,” Beranek said.

ECU’s previous research found that FIFO shift workers accumulate ‘sleep debt’ while working onsite, before they then return home. While it’s assumed this would allow workers to catch up on sleep, Beranek said the impacts of sleep debt could continue to be felt after returning home, as accumulated sleep loss can increase the risk of poor mental health and cardiovascular health.

“We also want to find out if workers’ sleep does actually improve once they’re in their own bed: do they have children waking them up, noisy neighbours, social commitments keeping them from getting enough sleep?” Beranek said.

Study participants will monitor their sleep environments during their time off work, with the research findings used to help improve the sleep health of workers in the resources sector, and the broader public.

“Research from the Sleep Health Foundation found inadequate sleep cost Australia $66.3 billion in 2016–17 — so it’s a major issue, not just in the resources sector. Improving this situation is in everyone’s interests, so we are expecting this research to lead to individual and organisational changes for the better,” Beranek said.

The program will look at a number of randomly selected facilities across metropolitan and regional areas of the state throughout the 2023/24 financial year. Inspectors will prioritise industry-specific hazards, along with workplace violence and aggression, staff training and other issues.

Residential aged care has been identified as an industry with significant challenges in relation to workplace violence and aggression and a high number of injuries due to manual handling and slips, trips and falls. The inspections will be conducted with a checklist to ensure consistency across all workplaces.

WorkSafe Deputy Commissioner Sally North said the proactive inspection program aims to help employers in the aged care industry fulfil their responsibilities for the health and safety of workers in their facilities. The inspection program will also provide information and collaboratively work towards a reduction in work-related injuries and illnesses in the targeted sectors.

“However, if our inspectors find non-compliance with work health and safety legislation, they will take appropriate action that could include the issuing of verbal directions or notices requiring the facility to remedy the situation. A wide range of safety issues may be present for workers in the aged care industry, and it’s our aim to make employers fully aware of the risks and supply them with information on the measures that can be put into place to lessen those risks,” North said.

More than 600 stonemasons have now had a comprehensive health assessment and received their diagnosis at The Alfred since it was launched in July 2021.

Workers can access a range of diagnostic tools and specialists during a single day at the clinic, increasing the likelihood of early-stage diagnosis and reducing the stress of multiple visits. WorkSafe Executive Director of Health and Safety Narelle Beer said the partnership with The Alfred to deliver a dedicated public hospital occupational respiratory clinic has been extended until July 2026. “This clinic plays such a crucial role in the health journey of so many Victorian workers facing an uncertain future and this ongoing collaboration will see that world-class care continue,” Beer said.

WorkSafe supports the clinic by taking calls from workers, families and employers before completing referrals for eligible workers and providing assistance with any claim lodgements. Many of WorkSafe’s past and present stonemasons had registered with WorkSafe’s own free silica health screening program, which commenced in May 2019 and supported more than 1100 workers. WorkSafe has now received 630 silicosis-related compensation claims following a positive diagnosis. Beer said there is much more work to be done to better understand the impacts of engineered stone and to increase the quality of life of injured workers.

“We will continue to do everything within our power to ensure employers are reducing the risks to health and safety and continue to hold them to account when they fail to protect their workers,” Beer said.

66,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Resources Safety and Health Queensland (RSHQ) is about to commence its underground coal mine safety exercise for another year and has also released footage from the mock emergency. In 2022, workers from Carborough Downs Coal Mine and volunteers at Queensland Mines Rescue Service (QMRS) partnered with RSHQ to prepare for life-threatening emergencies on the job. Two events, known as ‘Level 1 emergency exercises’, were hosted by Fitzroy Mining’s Carborough Downs Coal Mine underground operation, 25 km east of Moranbah in the heart of the Bowen Basin.

The exercises are kept as a surprise to the mine site and are often done at the end of the workers’ shift to challenge them. The first exercise, with QMRS, simulated a roof collapse that caused the gas concentration to reach an unsafe level inside the mine. A supervisor was also unaccounted for, and the last known location was in the area affected by the collapse. The exercise tested communication systems in place as well as the quality of equipment. The 2023 Level 1 emergency exercises will be held at an underground coal mine in September and November.

RSHQ Coal Mines Chief Inspector Jacques le Roux said the exercises can mean the difference between life and death. “RSHQ does all it can to prevent these emergencies in real life, but when they do occur we need to be ready,” le Roux said.

The second scenario, with Carborough Downs Coal Mine workers, mimicked a loss of energy supply from Ergon which wouldn’t be back up and running for at least 10 hours. Soon after the energy supply was cut, part of the mine collapsed, all communication to the surface was lost, and a crew member was struck in the head, knocking him unconscious.

Coal mine workers had to communicate with one another to rescue their colleague, while monitoring gas levels to ensure their own safety. It was especially challenging, as workers were forced to walk most of the way and carry their injured colleague to the surface. Underground coal miners usually have access to vehicles called Driftrunners but these were unable to be driven past a certain point due to methane levels in this exercise.

“The teams went really well, and we attribute that to a lot of the work the mines do outside of these big annual exercises. It also helps that most coal mines have QMRS volunteers working at their sites, so their skills become invaluable when disaster strikes,” le Roux said.

Queensland coal mines are required by law to have a minimum of 5% of their staff trained in underground mine rescue. Level 1 training, involving crews from across the state, occurs once a year, but each mine must undergo its own Level 2 training as well. The exercises give mine workers the skills to self-escape and triage injured co-workers.

“There is always room for improvement but that’s why we do these exercises, which highlight the importance for coal mines to re-evaluate their aided escape strategies. Our hope is that this experience and the findings in each annual report can benefit emergency response systems in other mines across Queensland and the rest of the country,” le Roux said.

A report on the 2022 exercises is available here. RSHQ has also instigated a push for all open cut mines to have mandatory Level 1 training by 2025.

67,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Transport Workers Union (TWU) and workers in the transport gig worker economy have urged Federal Parliament to urgently pass transport reform to make the industry safer and fairer, following the death of another food delivery rider in Sydney. The 13th food delivery rider known to have died in Australia was killed in Campbelltown at 6 pm on Saturday, 12 August, 2023, in a crash between a motorcycle and a ute. The incident occurred just three weeks after another food delivery rider, Akshay Deepak Doultani, was killed.

TWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said food delivery riders need safe working conditions and for the deadly pressures on them to be eased through transport reform. Kaine said that food delivery riders currently have no rights like a safe and fair minimum wage, sick leave, protection against unfair contract terminations, and workers compensation in the event that something goes wrong.

“The food delivery rider community is in mourning once again. Just three weeks after the tragic loss of Akshay Deepak Doultani, another food delivery rider has died at work. Our thoughts are with the rider’s loved ones at this terrible time. While nothing will compensate for the loss of 13 food delivery riders killed, we must act to stop more transport gig worker deaths on our roads, and to ensure all workers have access to safe working conditions and workers compensation for themselves and their families,” Kaine said.

A nationwide industry convoy of 1000 workers, transport employers and industry groups from across the transport industry, including dozens of food delivery riders and rideshare drivers, gathered earlier in the month to demand transport reform. In the last year, the TWU has signed charters with DoorDash, Uber and Menulog for reform to set standards in transport.

A McKell Institute survey of over 1000 transport gig workers revealed roughly half earn less than minimum wage and 56% of food delivery riders feel pressured to rush to make enough money and avoid losing their job. “Lifesaving reform to set fair, safe and sustainable standards in transport, including for gig workers, will soon be before Federal Parliament. This is literally life or death urgency — we call on every parliamentarian to pass this reform into law without delay,” Kaine said.

69,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The annual Steel Blue ‘Boot the Blues’ for Beyond Blue fundraising campaign recently hosted an online event attended by employers and workers within the resources, construction, agriculture and trades industries. When asked if they had accessed any supports and services to support their mental health, 40% of respondents to the Steel Blue Boot the Blues survey said they had spoken to a friend or family member and almost 30% had turned to their GP. In total, almost seven out of 10 had reached out to some form of support service suggesting that there is improving mental health awareness among men in blue collar industries.

Speaking at the event, Dr Grant Blashki, Lead Clinical Adviser, Beyond Blue, said friends and family are often the first port of call for Australians experiencing mental health challenges, adding that it is encouraging to see how tradies are becoming more comfortable speaking to someone and asking for help. “The importance of initiatives like Steel Blue’s collaboration with Beyond Blue is a real game changer. It opens up the conversation and reminds tradies who are experiencing mental health problems that they’re not alone and it’s worth accessing the excellent support out there which can literally change people’s lives and help them get back on track,” Blashki said.

Steel Blue Chief Sales Officer and Founding Director Ross Fitzgerald said the company has supported Beyond Blue for almost 10 years, working to raise awareness of good mental health across Australian worksites. “The knock-on effects of poor mental health among tradies can’t be understated in both economic, health and social terms. Physical health is often impacted during times of stress, which can lead to extended periods of time off work and loss of income,” Fitzgerald said.

Compared to 12 months earlier, 63% of survey respondents agreed that they know how to protect their mental health in times of stress, while 72% said they have a hobby that helps them relax. Additionally, 55% of respondents said they would reach out for help if they were experiencing distress, while 60% said they would feel comfortable talking to friends and family. 60% of respondents also said they were feel comfortable seeking professional help. In further encouraging signs, compared to 12 months earlier, 84% disagreed with the statement that depression is a sign of weakness.

Blashki said the ‘tough guy image’ of the blue collar worker is often a barrier to some seeking help for their mental health. “It’s very positive to see how many of the survey respondents dismissed the idea of depression being a sign of weakness. As a GP, I have seen a marked increase in the number of tradies walking through my door asking for help and I always make a point of taking seriously their mental health when the primary diagnosis is a physical injury.”

Steel Blue, which conducted the research in support of its partnership with Beyond Blue, has raised more than $400,000 for Beyond Blue, donating $10 from every sale of its blue safety boots. These funds have helped over 6150 Australians access free support. The Steel Blue survey found that speaking with others was the most common way for respondents to support their own mental health and wellbeing, with 40.48% having spoken to a friend or family member about their mental health and wellbeing. Furthermore, 18.59% of respondents have had an appointment with a psychologist.

Poor mental health has also had a considerable impact on survey respondents’ lives, as 30% have lost income, 47% have lost or had negatively impacted relationships and 54% have experienced decreased physical health. Half of the survey respondents said that poor mental health had an impact on their physical health, with one in four respondents having taken extended periods of time off work as a result of a physical injury at work. Over half of the respondents said that the injury impacted their mental health.

70,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Resources Safety and Health Queensland is calling on Queensland coalmines to improve how they operate articulated mobile cranes, following an increase in incidents. On Monday, 31 July 2023, a coalmine worker in Moranbah was operating an articulated mobile crane, or ‘pick and carry crane’, to lift a container when it fell to its side while turning. On Tuesday, 1 August 2023, a worker in Central Queensland was injured after he was hit in the knee by the load from a moving pick and carry crane, causing a fracture to his leg. He was flown to Rockhampton Hospital for treatment. RSHQ is investigating the cause of both incidents.

Chief Inspector of Coal Mines Jacques le Roux said more coalmine workers are in danger of being injured if best practice is not implemented and urged site senior executives to consider reducing the crane load capacity to cater for wheel ruts, potholes, protrusions and depressions found on flat mine surfaces.

“There are a number of reasons why we’re seeing more incidents, but a big one is operating on uneven ground. Very few areas on a mine site where articulated mobile cranes are utilised can be considered to be firm, level and uniform. It’s important to have no-go zones in place and enforced, to ensure there are no workers in harm’s way if a load drops from a crane,” Le Roux said.

Articulated mobile cranes are used in coalmines and are essentially a cross between a truck and a crane, allowing workers to move heavy loads. If weight is not evenly distributed, it often causes rollovers, loads falling, mechanical failures and collisions.

The Crane Industry Council of Australia estimates that articulated mobile cranes account for between 64 and 68% of all crane incidents. RSHQ has an ongoing goal of zero serious harm across all coalmines, with inspectors continuing to audit sites to improve the safety of all workers.","Resources Safety and Health Queensland is calling on Queensland coalmines to improve how they operate articulated mobile cranes, following an increase in incidents.

71,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"NT WorkSafe has issued a safety alert about the increased risk of fires if DC isolators are not installed correctly and in line with the manufacturers’ guidelines. Electrical safety inspectors have attended eight fires this year that started in the DC isolator of a solar PV system. Two properties suffered extensive fire damage.

Solar PV installers and electrical contractors are reminded to ensure the installation option selected is appropriate for the location of the DC isolator and the ingress protection of the isolator isn’t compromised during installation. Electrical safety inspectors have issued 22 infringement notices this year to solar PV installers for non-compliant installations. Owners of solar PV systems are advised to ensure that the required building permits are obtained before the installation begins. The installer must also provide an electrical certificate of compliance once the installation has been completed.

Owners of solar PV systems must also ensure that the installer provides the systems owner manual, warranty information and emergency shutdown information. The installer should also demonstrate the start-up and shutdown procedures, including how to safely isolate the system in case of an emergency. A scheduled maintenance program for the solar PV system must also be set, as outlined in the owner’s manual, for someone to regularly clean, inspect and test the system.

Owners who are concerned about their solar PV system are urged to contact a licensed electrical contractor for assistance and advice. A list of licensed electrical contractors is available on the Electrical Workers and Contractors Licensing Board website.

Electrical safety inspectors conduct random audits on new solar PV installations to ensure they are installed to the required standard. The audits occur at both commercial and residential properties and will require electrical safety inspectors to enter a property to examine the solar PV systems. All inspectors carry photo identification.

72,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Western Australia has launched two programs as part of a strategy to create safer workplaces and drive cultural change in the state’s resources sector. The SPEAK UP, REPORT IT campaign will reinforce the message that harassment and bullying in the resources sector are unacceptable. It will also remind senior executives, mine operators and workers of their responsibility to report workplace sexual harassment and other inappropriate behaviours towards women to WorkSafe. The campaign is among the actions taken by the state government, in response to recommendations from the parliamentary inquiry into the fly-in, fly-out mining industry.

WorkSafe WA’s 24/7 hotline, where callers can remain anonymous, has also been bolstered for victims and bystanders of workplace harassment or bullying. The number — 1800 678 198 — is also used for reporting other mines safety incidents to WorkSafe WA. Two additional staff have been employed to triage incoming calls and WorkSafe has delivered specialised training to ensure the service is provided in a trauma-informed manner. The campaign forms part of the government’s Mental Awareness, Respect and Safety program that boosts responses to mental health, workplace culture and mine safety.

The state government has also launched the Respect in Mining program, to increase awareness and knowledge of the impact of gender inequality on women’s safety and the impact of gendered division in leadership within the resources sector. Mining company Gold Fields Australia will participate in a 12-month pilot of the program across its WA operations, scheduled to begin in early 2024. Curtin University’s Collaboration for Evidence, Research and Impact in Public Health has created a suite of tools and resources for use in the pilot.

These tools provide guidance on how to review the new policies and procedures and monitor the overall shift in workplace culture to improve practice. The Respect in Mining Program is an initiative under the Mental Awareness, Respect and Safety program. Industrial Relations Minister Bill Johnston said the SPEAK UP, REPORT IT campaign highlights the state government’s commitment to promote workplace cultures that support inclusivity, respect and safety.

“We all have a responsibility to speak out against sexual harassment and other unacceptable workplace behaviours. It is vital there is a clear point of contact for those that experience sexual harassment at work. Sexual harassment is a work health and safety issue and we must confront it. This campaign is one of the wide-ranging actions we are taking to remind mine operators of their mandatory workplace reporting obligations,” Johnston said.

Women’s Interests Minister Sue Ellery said everyone has a right to feel safe and supported at work, adding that workplace sexual harassment is not a women’s issue, but a societal issue that all organisations, employers and individuals have a responsibility to address.

“I am pleased that Gold Fields Australia have agreed to pilot the Respect in Mining program and work with us to drive cultural change and help stamp out unacceptable behaviour. The program is one of many initiatives being undertaken by the Cook government that demonstrate our commitment to ensuring the Western Australian resources sector offers a safe and empowering workplace for all staff,” Ellery said.

73,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Tradies are reportedly disproportionately affected by workplace injuries and chronic conditions, with body stressing, lifting, pushing, pulling or bending the primary causes of workplace injuries, and the most serious injury claims involving joints and muscles. August is Tradies National Health Month (TNHM). The Australian Physiotherapy Association (APA) launched the campaign in 2012 to encourage tradies to stay healthy on the job by working with their physiotherapists, who are uniquely placed to prevent and treat musculoskeletal concerns throughout a worker’s lifespan.

APA Occupational Health Physiotherapist Lucia Tsui helps tradies who are experiencing problems consistent with the physical stressors of laborious work, many of which force tradies to take time off. Tsui said people who experience more serious work-related injuries generally require time off, with the latest data showing 66% of those who experienced an injury taking leave to recover.

“Our generation will likely work longer than our parents, but while life expectancy has increased, our health span — the number of years of good health — has not kept pace. Tradies know they put their bodies through a lot, and physiotherapists know tradies are busy. That is why we have compiled some quick, practical reasons for tradies to choose physio to help them live better for longer,” Tsui said.

Preventing injuries and treating them early is key, so that small issues don’t develop into more serious conditions that may keep tradies out of action for a longer term. Physiotherapists assess and treat tradies using a range of interventions and offer guidance on injury management, return to work and prevention strategies. They can also help with complex health conditions such as diabetes, pelvic floor muscle dysfunction and recovery from stroke.

“Physios can do a lot to assist tradies throughout their whole careers. We conduct worksite risk assessments, advise on how to set up your vehicles correctly to protect musculoskeletal health and help with poor sleep that affects tradies more than most other workers. Physios are also great at linking in with other health professionals when those underlying pains require efficient referral and communication with other services, including general practitioners, surgeons, podiatrists and mental health professionals,” Tsui said.

Tradies National Health Month is an opportunity for tradies to invest in their long-term health. It is also a time for employers, family members and friends to check in and help support tradies to have a long, healthy life on the job.

74,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) has called on federal parliament to pass lifesaving transport reform following the death of a food delivery rider on Saturday, 22 July 2023. The tragic incident is the 12th case of a food delivery rider known to have been killed in Australia since 2017, though underreporting of these incidents as workplace deaths indicates the death toll associated with this work is likely much higher.

News reports confirmed a 22-year-old motorcyclist was killed in Epping, Sydney following a crash at 8 pm. Passing food delivery riders believed the rider worked for food delivery company Fantuan, as they had noted the motorcyclist carrying a Fantuan food delivery bag. However, it has since been confirmed by police that the rider was working for UberEats at the time of the crash. A recent McKell study revealed that 79% of survey respondents use multiple apps, with three-quarters saying they need to do so to earn enough income, while a third said it’s for job security, to protect them against their accounts being deactivated by the algorithm.

The TWU will report this to SafeWork NSW as a workplace incident, although it is companies that are obliged to report any workplace death within 48 hours. The TWU has previously reported the death of food delivery rider Burak Dogan upon learning of the tragedy more than a year after his death. There is currently no system in Australia to provide transport gig workers with rights like minimum wage, sick leave, workers compensation or protection from unfair contract terminations, which can lead to unsafe driving.

The McKell survey found that almost half of its respondents earn less than minimum wage, rising to 66% for those working full-time hours. A quarter have experienced the instant job loss of ‘deactivation’ from the app which usually occurs when the algorithm deems the worker too slow or follows a customer complaint, with no investigation into its truthfulness and no right of reply. More than half of food delivery riders reported feeling pressured to rush and take risks to make enough money and avoid deactivation, while over a third reported that they’d been injured at work.

TWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said the task of removing the pressure on transport gig workers through reform to set fair, safe and sustainable standards in transport will soon be before federal parliament, and urged every politician to use their voice to pass this lifesaving reform into law.

“Our thoughts are with the rider’s loved ones after this horrific tragedy. Although no sum of money can compensate for this loss, grieving families of transport gig workers are twice wronged — first from the absence of rights that causes pressure to rush and take risks to pay the bills, and second from the denial of rights like workers compensation. The TWU will do everything within our power to get some justice for the family. Pressure to work long hours and at high speed to make enough money and avoid being sacked by an algorithm is killing workers in this country. Without rights, workers will continue to be slaughtered on our roads, regardless of bandaid solutions like ergonomic bags and high-visibility jackets,” Kaine said.

75,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A University of South Australia study, in collaboration with mental health charity MATES in Construction (MATES), has explored the drivers of suicidal thoughts and psychological distress for workers in the construction industry. Long work hours and job insecurity are reportedly driving thoughts and distress among some Australian construction workers who are experiencing pressure from the industry’s demands. The strain of working in a sector that by nature is often transient, requires hard physical labour and assumes self-reliance and risk-taking attitudes, is pushing some workers to distress. These factors have contributed to the 190 cases of suicide within the Australian construction industry every year, equating to one worker taking their life every second day.

The researchers reviewed the coping strategies that workers have adopted, as well as what the industry can do to lower the risk of losing more of its workers. A group of construction industry workers employed in a variety of roles were interviewed about their personal experiences with suicidal thoughts while employed in the sector, or their experience supporting a workmate with suicidal thoughts.

UniSA PhD candidate Simon Tyler said eight themes relating to what may drive suicidal thoughts and distress were identified. These included challenges directly related to working within the industry, such as working long hours, workplace transience and job insecurity, which are common issues in the sector. “The people who discussed these issues saw them as increasing in intensity in recent times and said they played a significant part in experiences of suicidal thoughts and distress,” Tyler said.

Other themes driving suicidal thoughts and distress related to personal issues, such as relationship and family concerns, social disconnection, personal financial hardship, perceived lack of support, alcohol and drug use, child custody/access and legal issues, mental health challenges, trauma or a significant adverse life event. Many participants also said the stigma around mental health and suicide among workmates limits them from reaching out for help.

“I think it’s just the stigma. If you have a broken arm people can see and touch and feel it … but mental health. You cannot touch it and feel it and it’s not accepted,” said one participant. Other participants discussed thoughts of feeling trapped and overwhelmed. “… to get me away from that situation, I was either going to take my life or I was going to quit,” one participant said.

Tyler said suicide is a significant concern for the construction industry. “The nature of the construction industry can be challenging with workplace drivers such as employment uncertainty, as well as industry cultures that encourage self-reliance attitudes and behaviours, but it’s also a sector that is determined to change and help better the lives of the people it employs,” he said.

MATES in Construction is dedicated to creating this change and aims to reduce the high number of suicides in the industry and raise awareness and peer support skills among workers. MATES delivers prevention and mental health programs to the building, mining, energy and construction sectors. Since its programs were introduced, the organisation has trained more than 237,000 industry workers and estimates the suicide risk in the industry has dropped by about 8%. MATES SA CEO Alan Suridge said participants identified what helped them personally or had helped others who were experiencing challenges with mental health and suicidal thoughts.

“Mates in Construction is a three-tiered awareness program that teaches workers how to recognise when a mate is struggling and where to go for help. We then provide free counselling and support services to workers in need. Research such as this enables us to educate workers on signs to look for and how to respond appropriately, creating a safer, more caring workplace community,” Suridge said.

The research findings can be found here.

76,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A combined infrastructure pipeline worth $647 billion over five years from 2021–22 to 2025–26:

Major public infrastructure projects reflect $237 billion over five years — a growth of $15 billion in 12 months — mostly focused on transport (63% of spend) and highly skewed to New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland (84% of spend), with other infrastructure projects representing $410 billion.*

Effective Traffic Incident Management (TIM) is essential to minimising the impact of incidents, reducing congestion and improving road safety. Traffic represents one of the highest WHS risks to Road Infrastructure and Asset Managers, Engineers, Supervisors and Project Managers due to the volume of activities that occur on and near roads and the serious outcomes that may arise in the event of a traffic incident.

The newly released AR Interactive — National Guide to Public Works & Services Safety 2023/24 produced in conjunction with NSW & ACT Institute of Public Works Engineering Australasia (IPWEA) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation, Before You Dig Australia (BYDA) presents information and guidelines relating to the factors that need to be considered in applying Road Traffic Incident Management (TIM) techniques and treatments to road types that include motorways and expressways, urban arterial roads, urban local roads, rural highways and rural local roads. TIMS personnel, whether it be internal Transport and Main Roads or a contracted agent, must comply with all requirements with respect to work health and safety (WHS) provisions and must hold current certification to Quality Management System AS/NZS ISO 9001:2016 and Occupational Health and Safety Management System AS/NZS 4801:2001 to develop and supply appropriate Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS).

77,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A new project to prevent workplace sexual harassment against women from migrant and refugee backgrounds has been launched with a $100,000 grant from the Western Australian Government. Funded through the Women’s Grants for a Stronger Future Program, the Zero Tolerance initiative will be delivered by the Multicultural Services Centre of Western Australia (MSCWA) to promote safe, respectful and inclusive workplaces for culturally and linguistically diverse women.

The project will establish an online information hub with specialised support and referrals for migrant and refugee women who experience sexual harassment. Zero Tolerance will provide training programs to help raise awareness, reduce barriers to reporting incidents in the workplace and contribute to preventing gender-based violence in the community.

MSCWA staff will receive training to deliver information on workers’ rights, including workplace sexual harassment. The initiative will also provide free access to interpreters for people whose first language is not English if they are involved in a workplace sexual harassment complaint. The project aligns with recommendations from the Australian Human Rights Commission’s Respect@Work: Sexual Harassment National Inquiry Report (2020), which found that 39% of women had experienced workplace sexual harassment in the past five years.

The Commission found that migrant and refugee women were more likely than the general population to experience sexual harassment. The MSCWA was one of 14 community organisations to receive funding through the Women’s Grants for a Stronger Future program. Total program funding was increased from $85,000 to $335,000, with grants spread across the areas of women’s health and wellbeing, economic independence, safety and justice to align with the state government’s ‘Stronger Together: WA’s Plan for Gender Equality’.

Women’s Interests Minister Sue Ellery said women should be safe and respected at work, with appropriate access to services and support if they experience sexual harassment at the workplace.

“The Cook government is committed to supporting women from all backgrounds and will continue to support efforts and community organisations that push back against inappropriate workplace behaviour. We still have a long road ahead to address issues of inequity in the workplace — a challenge that has been accepted by Multicultural Services Centre of WA’s Zero Tolerance project and other grant recipients,” Ellery said.

MSCWA Chairperson Sheila Rajan said the Zero Tolerance project would effectively address the key concerns that impact culturally and linguistically diverse women in Western Australia. “In the decades of my involvement with the multicultural sector I can’t recall an occasion where a multicultural services provider has been by far the largest single beneficiary of a grants program. So, this is a very historic occasion, and we commend the Cook Labor government and Women’s Interests Minister Sue Ellery,” Rajan said.

The snapshot provides insights about the types and causes of work-related injuries and diseases experienced by apprentices and trainees, particularly those in the construction and manufacturing industries.

The snapshot found that from 2016–17 to 2020–21, the number of serious claims (involving total absence from work of one week or more) for apprentices and trainees rose by 41% despite the number of apprentices and trainees increasing only 13%. The construction, manufacturing and other services industries accounted for more than two-thirds of all serious workers compensation claims for apprentices and trainees; 49.9% of these claims were for workers in the construction industry alone.

For apprentices and trainees under 30 in the construction industry, the most common type of work-related injury was lacerations or open wounds not involving traumatic amputation, while falls, trips and slips were the most common cause of work-related injury.

Lacerations or open wounds not involving traumatic amputation were the most common type of work-related injury for apprentices and trainees under 30 in the manufacturing industry. The most common cause of work-related injury was being hit by moving objects.

Powered mobile plant such as forklifts and delivery vehicles are a major cause of workplace death and injury in Australian workplaces. ReturnToWorkSA data indicates that powered mobile plant has contributed to the most injury claims within the transport, postal and warehousing industries for FY 2017–18 to FY 2019–20.

Since January 2020, SafeWork SA has issued 65 improvement notices involving the ineffective traffic management of powered mobile plant and seven prohibition notices involving loading activities of powered mobile plant. Throughout the six-month campaign, inspectors will visit metropolitan and regional businesses across the state to ensure compliance of workplace traffic management systems of powered mobile plant and delivery vehicles, particularly those that operate in the same area as pedestrians.

Compliance activities will focus on systems, records and training; operations, inspection and testing of powered mobile plant; how loading and unloading of material is undertaken; the suitability of lifting attachments for the load being lifted; and high-risk work licensing. If non-compliance identified during the audit cannot be remedied while the inspector is onsite, a statutory notice will be issued. The inspectors will also provide advice, information and education in relation to traffic management.

Under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 (SA), business owners are responsible for ensuring, so far as is reasonably practicable, that plant is without risks to the health and safety of any person.

80,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Comcare has released a Mental Notes program to reduce mental health-related stigma in the workplace and encourage wellbeing at work. The program also aims to increase manager/supervisor knowledge and skills to support workers’ mental health, encourage support and promote help-seeking behaviour.

Psychological claims for workers compensation currently account for approximately one-third of new claims from Australian public service workers in the Comcare jurisdiction, with bullying and harassment and work pressure the main causes. The claims are often more complex and take longer to resolve. Workers who make a compensation claim for a psychological injury often have poorer recovery and return to work outcomes than those with a physical injury or disease. Fear and stigma around mental ill-health can prevent workers from seeking the support they need from their employer or a trained professional.

Workplaces that support the psychological health and wellbeing of workers by addressing stigma early and encouraging help-seeking behaviour are more likely to experience less absenteeism, presenteeism, employee turnover and psychological claims. The program provides practical strategies to help identify and manage psychosocial safety risks, and help assess and make appropriate adjustments to support staff in the workplace.

Program resources available on Comcare’s website include a manager’s resource kit, practical resources for managers and supervisors, fact sheets, conversation guides, templates and other communication materials. Mental Notes was informed and tested with managers, workers and people with lived experience of mental health issues.

81,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"New child employment laws have come into effect in Victoria, with a modernised and simpler licensing system and stronger penalties to ensure kids under 15 are kept as safe as possible in the workplace. Wage Inspectorate Victoria is urging employers to take time to understand the laws, as research exposes common misconceptions about child employment.

Research shows that 33% of Victorians mistakenly believe 14 and 9 months is the age that kids can start working and a further 25% believe they have to be 15 to get a job, but provided the employer has a licence, children can do delivery work from 11 and other types of work from 13. Wage Inspectorate Victoria reports that 14 and 9 months used to be the age that kids could leave school and enter the workforce, which is where the myth has come from, but Victoria’s child employment laws say nothing about being 14 and nine months and they haven’t for a long time.

The new laws, designed in consultation with stakeholders and the community, see a licensing system replace a permit system and enable businesses to employ multiple kids under one licence, instead of needing a permit for each child they employ. The system includes a ‘fit and proper person’ test which considers, among other things, an employer’s compliance with child employment and other relevant workplace laws.

Wake Inspectorate Victoria now has stronger powers and the maximum penalty for employing a child without a licence has increased from $18,500 to more than $200,000. In addition to obtaining a licence, employers must follow other rules, like making sure kids are getting adequate rest breaks, finishing work by 9 pm and not working during school hours.

Robert Hortle, Commissioner of Wage Inspectorate Victoria, said the tougher penalties show that taking advantage of children in the workplace will not be tolerated. “Working can provide valuable experience for kids, but they’re still developing both mentally and physically and require extra precautions in the workplace. The new system reduces the burden for businesses but not the protection for kids. We’ll still be out there monitoring compliance throughout the state. It’s great to give young workers a go, but it’s important to do so safely,” Hortle said.

83,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"South Australia has introduced new laws to make industrial manslaughter a criminal offence. Under the Work Health and Safety (Industrial Manslaughter) Amendment Bill, individuals can face a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment, and $18 million for companies, if they are reckless or grossly negligent in conduct which breaches a work health and safety duty and results in the death of another person.

These new laws ensure the most serious health and safety breaches carry a penalty, which sends a message that people who place workers’ lives at risk will be held to account. These penalties also recognise the loss suffered by the families of workers who die in preventable workplace incidents.

The introduction of this Bill brings South Australia into line with other jurisdictions that have made industrial manslaughter a crime, including Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and the ACT. The new laws do not impose any new duties that are not already owed under current workplace laws. Instead, it ensures that when those duties are breached, resulting in the death of a person, the penalty reflects the severity of the crime.

The legislation follows a significant community consultation process, which included unions, business groups, and work health and safety professionals. Kyam Maher said industrial manslaughter laws recognise that, while tragic workplace incidents do occur from time to time, it’s not an accident when people deliberately cut corners and place workers’ lives at risk.

“Every South Australian deserves to be safe in the workplace and come home to their loved ones at the end of each day. The overwhelming majority of businesses in South Australia do the right thing and take the health and safety of their workers seriously. I pay tribute to the many families of victims of workplace incidents who have campaigned for these laws. I hope these changes to the legislation will ensure no family has to experience this again,” Maher said.

85,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Following the release of the 2020 Independent Review into Workplace Equality within Ambulance Victoria, the state government is taking steps to support the establishment of an independent restorative engagement scheme, per the recommendations made by the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission (VEOHRC). The 2020 Independent Review outlined the prevalence of unacceptable behaviour in the industry; following the establishment of the independent restorative engagement scheme, Ambulance Victoria’s employees and volunteers will be heard and their experiences in the workplace acknowledged.

Work will commence this month to establish the new scheme, which will help rebuild trust, strengthen safety and respect, and improve the culture at Ambulance Victoria, as recommended by the VEOHRC. As part of its review into workplace equality, VEOHRC recommended establishing a scheme for current and former employees and volunteers who had experienced discrimination, sexual harassment, bullying and victimisation at Ambulance Victoria.

Work will now commence on developing options that will be explored by the Department of Justice and Community Safety — which will work closely with employees and volunteers as well as their unions, professional associations and the Department of Health. The scheme will offer a range of outcomes, including individual apologies, statements of regret and financial compensation, as well as restorative sessions with senior leaders. All outcomes will be focused on what matters most to the participant and consideration will be given on how to best support each participant through the process.

The state government will receive advice by the end of the year on options for the scheme, which will launch next year and run for at least 18 months, backed by an investment of $8 million to support the delivery of VEOHRC’s recommendations, which have been accepted in full. Ambulance Victoria has also released an implementation plan with work underway to implement all recommendations.

Minister for Ambulance Services Gabrielle Williams said the scheme will be carefully designed and in place next year. “This restorative process is about listening, acknowledging and responding to the harm caused to anyone that was discriminated against or who experienced sexual harassment, bullying and victimisation. The kind of behaviours we heard about through VEOHRC’s investigation are completely unacceptable and there is no place in Ambulance Victoria for those who engage in or seek to protect harmful or unlawful conduct,” Williams said.

A concerning trend has been observed in industry where an increasing number of incidents can be linked back to insufficient assessment of risks such as stored energy, exclusion zones, line-of-fire and incorrect equipment selection or improper use. These risks increase when circumstances change during the execution of the job and no, or insufficient, risk reassessment is done. While it will take time before the root causes of incidents are established, there are some general principles that should be revisited by industry, which may improve the identification of risks and the implementation of effective controls for these kinds of activities.

Schedule 3 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (OPGGS Act) imposes duties on operators, persons in control of particular work at a facility and employers at a facility to take reasonably practicable steps to protect persons at the facility, the persons doing particular work at the facility and employees from risks to their health and safety. The general process that can lead to the safety of personnel includes hazard identification, supporting safety studies, risk assessments, demonstration of risks as low as reasonably practicable, control measures and performance standards.

Each facility operator may have their own approach or tools within this process to meet the types of risks of the activity. Regardless of the specific methods used, a key component of the process relates to how the workforce is exposed to the residual risks resulting from these controls. Whichever method of hazard identification through to effective risk controls is chosen, NOPSEMA advises executives at the top of the organisation to oversee the process, to ensure its effectiveness and that it will result in safe work across all activities.

NOPSEMA also advises employers to implement a hierarchy of controls to all activities undertaken at a facility. A hierarchy of controls includes elimination (where a hazard is either eliminated or avoided), and the implementation of engineering controls. These include control measures that are physical in nature, including mechanical devices such as trolleys or hoists to move heavy loads. If it is known that an engineering control is available on the market, employers are advised to consider its availability for their specific worksite during the work preparation phase.

Administrative controls are work methods or procedures designed to minimise exposure to a hazard. In most cases, administrative controls use systems of work to control the risk. This includes procedures on how to operate equipment safely or limiting exposure time to a hazardous task. A change in circumstances (environmental, time-of-day, equipment failure or availability) should at all times initiate a reassessment of the risks connected to the job at hand. However, using administrative controls and PPE to reduce risks does not control the hazard at the source; administrative controls and PPE rely on human behaviour and supervision and, used on their own, tend to be least effective in minimising risks.

Operators of a facility, persons in control of parts of a facility or particular work at a facility and employers at a facility should refer to their general and specific duties as set out in Part 2, Division 1 of Schedule 2 of the OPGGS Act, which are intended to secure the health, safety, and welfare of persons at or near facilities; and protect persons at or near facilities from risks to health and safety.

87,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"People who assault retail workers will face tougher penalties under the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Assaults on Retail Workers) Bill 2023, which introduces three new offences into the Crimes Act 1990. The reforms, introduced to Parliament by the NSW Government, make it an offence to assault, throw a missile at, stalk, harass or intimidate a retail worker in the course of the worker’s duty, even if no actual bodily harm is caused to the worker, with a maximum penalty of four years’ imprisonment.

It is also an offence to assault a retail worker in the course of the worker’s duty and cause actual bodily harm to the worker, with a maximum penalty of six years’ imprisonment. The new reforms stipulate that it is an offence to wound or cause grievous bodily harm to a retail worker in the course of the worker’s duty, being reckless as to causing actual bodily harm to the worker or another person, with a maximum penalty of 11 years’ imprisonment.

Research from the McKell Institute, commissioned by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, found that 85% of retail workers have been abused or assaulted at work. During the pandemic, a new definition was brought about for essential workers and people working on the frontline inside stores and supermarkets who were subject to increased abuse while on the job. Videos of retail workers being assaulted have been widely shared on social media, with many shocking and violent abuses caught on camera.

NSW Premier Chris Minns said the bill reflects the NSW Government’s commitment to support workers and ensure their safety in the workplace. “Everyone should be treated with decency and respect while at work. There is no excuse for assaulting anyone, particularly not someone who is doing their job,” Minns said.

Minister for Industrial Relations and Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis said this type of offending causes enormous distress for shop workers, their families and the wider community and can leave lasting emotional scars, as well as those caused by injury. “It’s crucial that people feel safe when going to work and these changes will provide a deterrent for those who would behave in this manner to people trying to provide them with a service. I’ve heard firsthand from retail workers who have experienced terrible abuse which has affected their working life; this legislation signals the government’s support for our workers and their safety,” Cotsis said.

NSW Attorney General Michael Daley said the new offences will carry more severe penalties than general assault provisions, and send a message that this behaviour is unacceptable. “Everyone deserves to feel safe at work and that includes retail workers; they are essential to our economy and society and should not be subject to violence, abuse or threats. We are committed to ensuring the justice system protects workers and that penalties are appropriate and meet community standards,” Daley said.

89,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Recent findings suggest the prevalence of poor mental health in the mining industry is high and the risk of psychological distress in remote mining was significantly higher among workers aged 44 years or less, and has increased in the past six years compared to all other industries.1. 2. 3.

There are a number of mental health problems unique to the Mining and Quarry Industry, whose cause is directly influenced by the work involved, examples being the hazardous environment, work organisation (shift work schedules, fly-in fly-out, compressed roster swings), interpersonal relations (work-family conflicts), psychosocial risk at work (high job demand, job stress), wellbeing (quality of life, job satisfaction) and substance abuse. A perceived culture of incivility within a team or worksite is also linked to poorer mental health, as well as a higher frequency and severity of aggressive, bullying or harassment, and sexual violence workplace behaviours.

The AR Interactive — Mining & Quarry Industry Guide to Workplace Safety 2023/24 produced in conjunction with industry partnering Associations, Mates in Mining, Australian Resources and Energy Employer Association (AREEA), Minerals Industry Safety & Health Centre (MISHC) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation assists in recognising and controlling the key hazards and risks associated with the Mining and Quarry Industry, with the latest WHS Regulatory Guidelines and Framework focused on proactive prevention of injury, ill-health and essential information in order to help create a workplace safety culture of Zero Harm.

Mental Health and Support is a primary focus viewed through the framework of risk management, protecting all workers from psychological workplace hazards in light of the model Work Health and Safety (WHS) Laws, which now include regulations on psychosocial hazards and a new model Code of Practice Managing Psychosocial Hazards at Work.

90,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A year on from the release of the ‘Enough is Enough’ report, the Australian Resources & Energy Employer Association (AREEA) has taken steps to address sexual misconduct and harassment in the mining industry. AREEA deputy CEO Tara Diamond said the report’s findings spurred AREEA to collaborate on reducing unacceptable patterns of workplace behaviour. “While there is more work to do, much has been achieved over the last 12 months,” Diamond said.

AREEA formed the National Industry Taskforce on Workplace Sexual Harassment — comprising 16 resources and energy employer representatives with a range of professional disciplines and expertise. As part of the taskforce’s goal to drive meaningful change, AREEA’s ‘That’s why I speak up’ campaign was launched in November 2022. The behavioural intervention campaign features a suite of education and awareness materials that has since been adopted by worksites. AREEA also released the Female Role Model Toolkit, combining research, case studies and advice for AREEA members on how to support female inclusion and equity in the workforce, increase visibility of female role models and celebrate female leaders.

Diamond said that creating greater awareness and acceptance of female role models — particularly those flourishing in professions traditionally dominated by men — sends a strong message to overcome gender stereotypes and biases. “As an industry, we are building our reputation for personal safety, with zero tolerance for harassment, bullying, gendered violence and other forms of unacceptable behaviour. It’s fundamentally about respect for women in the workplace,” Diamond said.

AREEA has partnered with BDO REMSMART to produce a Workforce Insights survey covering sexual harassment and bullying, with policies and procedures for prevention and response. The survey initially involved approximately 115 companies and is expected to grow as it is established biannually. In future, the survey will provide more granular information on contractor safety management (Recommendation 6) and alcohol standards (Recommendation 4).

The survey will also track industry activities around a number of other recommendations in the report, including Recommendation 7 (concerning the development of a framework identifying risk factors), Recommendation 66 (about options for reporting and support), Recommendation 11 (which calls for a central coordinator or record keeper), Recommendation 14 (the establishment of a 24/7 third-party anonymous reporting platform) and Recommendation 23 (the development of comprehensive standards and guidelines for the integration of sexual harassment into work health and safety practice).

91,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A study into the impact of shift work has found that more education needs to be provided to early career paramedics about sleep problems and the potential safety hazards associated with around-the-clock rosters. The Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute and Appleton Institute study was funded by SafeWork SA after winning an August Zadow Award in 2021. The report was published in April 2023, based on a survey of 30 young paramedics from around Australia.

The paramedics had an average age of 30 years with participants having about five years’ experience in the field. Almost 90% of those surveyed were currently assigned to shift work. The study found that paramedics had limited knowledge about sleep health and sleep disorders, including where to obtain help for a sleep problem. Sleep loss and fatigue were common factors associated with shift work and often led to emotional imbalances at work and at home, as well as perceived poorer clinical performance.

Lead researcher Associate Professor Amy Reynolds said shift work is an intrinsic component of paramedic work, and its impacts on sleep need to be an education and health services priority. The survey revealed that early-career paramedics would have liked to receive more education regarding shift work and sleep health. “They want to hear this information from other paramedics with lived experience as well as sleep health experts either before commencing shift work, or during early employment. They also want to know where to go for help with their sleep,” Reynolds said.

The study found that paramedics use a range of strategies to manage fatigue, including coffee consumption, use of sleep medications and maintaining good routines around their shift work. These strategies are largely learned on the job from mentors and peers, with most participants reporting that they received limited or no formal education on how to effectively manage shift work and fatigue.

Reynolds said the next steps from the study will include publications that address the current knowledge gap in the literature regarding how shift work, fatigue and sleep loss impact Australian paramedic workplace performance and safety as well as personal wellbeing. “We also intend to utilise this knowledge to develop education and support toolkits for pre-service and early-career Australian paramedics to better support health and safety during the transition into shift work,” Reynolds said.

92,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"More than two-thirds of audits conducted during an ongoing SafeWork SA asbestos management compliance campaign have resulted in statutory notices being issued. In the first four weeks of the asbestos registers campaign, SafeWork SA inspectors issued 21 improvement notices across 30 worksite audits. The 67% of worksites that did not comply with asbestos management marks an increase from 58% of worksites in the 2022 campaign. The campaign is also supported by a concurrent audit focusing on asbestos management prior to demolition and renovations.

This part of the campaign has resulted in 14 licensed asbestos removal sites being visited and another 21 statutory notices being issued, consisting of 10 Prohibition Notices and 11 Improvement Notices. During the first four weeks of the demolition or refurbishment campaign, two licensed asbestos removalists were immediately suspended on 1 and 18 May 2023 for failing to identify and remove asbestos prior to demolition, while another removalist received a proposal to suspend its licence on 8 May 2023 after multiple non-compliance issues were identified at a removal site.

Working with asbestos requires a high degree of regulatory control, with licensing in place to achieve this. SafeWork SA Executive Director Glenn Farrell said the high percentage of audits resulting in notices is concerning. “Our inspectors will consider issuing expiation notices and taking prosecution action where duty holders continue to breach their obligations of ensuring people’s health and safety is not adversely affected from the risks associated with asbestos,” Farrell said.

Australia reportedly has one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with approximately 4000 deaths each year from exposure to asbestos. The campaign is an action item from the South Australian Asbestos Action Plan (SA AAP) and is one of the national targets of the National Strategic Plan for Asbestos Awareness and Management 2019–2023.

93,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"An Interim Report into the Independent Review of SafeWork NSW has been released, taking the state’s safety regulator a step closer to change. The Review, headed by Retired Supreme Court Judge Hon. Robert McDougall KC, was established in October 2022 and aims to investigate the effectiveness of the state’s work health and safety body, SafeWork NSW.

The Minister for Work Health and Safety, Sophie Cotsis, said the interim report is a step forward to change, adding that there is a need for the report due to a failure to ensure compliance and enforcement by the previous government. Under the previous government, there were also significant structural changes made to the SafeWork NSW system, which are now being analysed. The review also aims to investigate presumed inefficiencies at SafeWork NSW, including that SafeWork is slow to act on safety warnings and that onsite inspections are too slow and too rare. The review is designed to be an inquisitorial rather than an adversarial process.

Cotsis said that SafeWork NSW plays a vital role in protecting the health and safety of workers in the state and it is important that any issues relating to its operations are examined and addressed. “After an 18-month campaign to get this review, the former government had to be dragged and exposed before it finally came onboard. I have been pushing to get this review done long before I was appointed in this role. We will continue to ensure that we have a partnership between industry, unions, communities and government. I look forward to receiving the final report at the end of November, to help support better outcomes for workers and employers in NSW,” Cotsis said.

While specific cases and detailed issues raised can be considered as part of the Review, it will not make determinations relating to specific work health and safety concerns. The Review’s focus is on identifying deficiencies and recommendations at the organisational level.

“Everyone deserves to come home safely to their loved ones and to be safe at work,” Cotsis said.

94,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union (AMWU), representing thousands of welders, boilermakers and fitters who are exposed to welding fumes, has condemned Safe Work Australia’s decision not to lower the limit for exposure to welding fumes. The AMWU has been calling for the limit set by the Workplace Exposure for Welding Fumes (WES) to be lowered from 5 mg/m3 to 1 mg/m3 since 2021, when Safe Work Australia moved to abolish the standard altogether.

Through the ACTU, the AMWU repeated its call at a meeting of Safe Work Australia to immediately lower the limit for welding fumes exposure in workplaces and fund research into a health-based standard and atmosphere monitoring methodology.

Safe Work Australia has instead opted to carry out a review of the WES that could take a significant amount of time and resources without any guarantee of strengthening Australian safety standards around welding fumes at the end of the process. Welding fume was classified as a Group 1 carcinogen in 2017.

AMWU National President Andrew Dettmer said the WES limit has not been updated since it was set in the 1990s, leaving workers unnecessarily exposed. “The science on welding fumes causing cancer was settled years ago, and we know that welders have an almost 50% higher risk of developing lung cancer. Let’s act now, not in another two years’ time, to strengthen our safety standards and lower welding fumes exposure in the workplace. The science is in. If Safe Work Australia won’t act, we’ll be calling on Minister Tony Burke to intervene. The health and safety of welders can’t wait for yet another pointless review,” Dettmer said.

95,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has reported 15- to 25-year-olds have a 75% greater chance of being injured at work with apprentice deaths and serious injuries peaking between 7 am and 10 am.

Approximately 15% of the Australian workforce is made up of workers between 15 and 24 years* and over 14,000 serious workers compensation claims are made by workers in this age group. One of the contributing factors to workplace injuries is young and inexperienced workers being unable to recognise and cope with potential hazards.

As an employer, you must ensure the work environment and the way workers carry out their work is safe, regardless of the type and terms of their employment. This includes protecting young workers from both physical and psychological workplace hazards. Employers of young workers and apprentices should ensure the apprentice is supervised at all times and working safely, with the correct use of PPE, including making sure they participate in Toolbox Talks and sign off on Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS).

Safety for Young Workers and Apprentices who are the most inexperienced on worksites is a key focus of the newly released AR Interactive - NSW Construction Site Safety Guide 2023/24 produced in conjunction with Master Builders Association of NSW (MBA NSW), The Crane Industry Council of Australia (CICA), Concrete Sawing & Drilling Association of Australia (CSDAA) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation.

96,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Australian federal government has ratified two International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions during the annual ILO Conference. The ILO Convention No. 190 (Violence and Harassment) and ILO Convention No. 138 (Minimum Age) were ratified in Geneva at a tripartite ceremony. Minister for Skills and Training Brendan O’Connor was joined at the event during the ILO conference by ACTU President Michele O’Neil and employer representative Natalie Heazlewood.

The ILO Violence and Harassment Convention provides a comprehensive framework for governments and employers to prevent, address and reduce the risks of violence and harassment at work. The ACTU played a key role in the negotiations for the new Convention over the 2018 and 2019 International Labour Conferences and has campaigned for Australia to ratify it since the Convention was adopted in 2019.

Ratification of Convention 190 was also a recommendation of the Respect@Work Report. Now ratified, the ILO Violence and Harassment Convention will support the full extension of the 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave entitlement to all 12 million employees in Australia by September 2024.

The ILO Minimum Age Convention is one of the 10 ILO Conventions classified as “fundamental” and a key international instrument in the right to eliminate child labour and forced labour. ACTU President Michele O’Neil said all working people deserve to work in a safe environment, free from violence and harassment. The ILO Convention 190 recognises every worker’s right to be free from all forms of violence and harassment at work, including gender-based violence and harassment.

O’Neil said that the ratification of ILO Convention 190 will save lives and ensure that workers impacted by family and domestic violence don’t have to choose between their safety and their job. O’Neil welcomed the ratification of the ILO Minimum Age Convention, calling it “long overdue”.

“Recent child labour law breaches by Muffin Break, Red Rooster and Cold Rock show the importance of strong standards that protect children from exploitation. Australian Unions work every day to make workplaces safer and played a key role in the development of this groundbreaking Convention, and campaigning for its implementation. Australian unions have a long and proud history of campaigning for the rights of workers in Australia and around the world. Ratification of these two important ILO Conventions is Australia playing its part in upholding and implementing important international standards for workers,” O’Neil said.

97,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"NT WorkSafe has issued a safety alert after four workers were injured in four separate angle grinder incidents within a five-week period. In the first incident, a young apprentice boilermaker was using an angle grinder to cut plates off a bumper bar when the grinder kicked back into his hand and the cutting disc broke. The apprentice required surgery for over five hours and was lucky to not have lost his thumb. In a separate incident, a worker was using an angle grinder to cut sheet metal for ductwork when the grinder ‘grabbed’ and kicked back, lacerating the worker’s hand. A handle was not attached to the grinder when the incident occurred.

A first-year apprentice was cutting a section of metal frame using a five-inch angle grinder when metal particles entered his eye, requiring medical treatment. The incident occurred even though the apprentice was wearing safety glasses. In the fourth incident, a construction worker was injured and required surgery when the angle grinder he was holding kicked back into his hand. The worker was using an older model nine-inch grinder that did not have a safety switch when he accidentally hit the start switch before he had full control of the grinder.

Angle grinders can be dangerous power tools if used incorrectly and have caused a number of serious injuries in the Northern Territory. The main causes of injuries are being hit by flying particles from the item being ground or cut, being hit by fragments of the grinder disc if it breaks and being cut by the grinder when it kicks back.

NT WorkSafe has urged all workplaces using angle grinders to undertake Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Control (HIRAC) before starting any job. NT WorkSafe also recommends that employers ensure the right tool is used for the material being cut, and to consider whether tools like mitre saws, cold saws or gas cutting kits (such as oxy-acetylene) are a safer option for the job. Due to an increased risk of injury, employers are urged to consider other alternatives before using a nine-inch (230 mm) angle grinder. The use of older model grinders that don’t have automatic cut-off or dead-man switches is not recommended. Employers should also ensure workers have the appropriate information and training (including the manufacturer’s safety instructions) and that they are competent in using an angle grinder.

Employers and workers should select an angle grinder that has an automatic cut-off or dead-man switch, a removable side handle that can be attached to suit a left- or right-handed user and moveable guards that can be repositioned.

Employers are advised to make sure the correct disc type is used for the work being done and is suitable for the material being cut or ground. The flange and locking nut must also be compatible with the disc used. Worn or damaged discs must be replaced, and discs that have been dropped should not be used. Employers should also ensure that the guards and handle supplied by the manufacturer are used and that the guard covers have the disc.

NT WorkSafe advises employers and workers to wear eye protection such as wide-vision goggles, safety glasses or face shields; tight-fitting clothes and gloves should also be worn to prevent entanglement. They are also encouraged to wear earmuffs for hearing protection. Employers must also provide appropriate supervision for inexperienced workers.

98,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The TWU is calling on WorkSafe to launch investigations into the supply chains of the trucks involved in the two school bus incidents which occurred one week apart, as well as to open up a broader line of inquiry into supply chain pressures on trucking companies in the state.

The Transport Workers Union (TWU) Vic/Tas Branch has called for WorkSafe Victoria to investigate the supply chain pressures in trucking after a second school bus crash in the state, in which early reports suggested that a truck was involved. The TWU said these incidents are a reminder of the essential work performed by both truck and bus drivers for the community and the absolute requirements to ensure transport workers have the safest possible working conditions.

Decades of evidence have shown that financial pressures from cost-cutting in transport supply chains squeeze operators and drivers and cause dangerous pressure to delay maintenance, meet unrealistic deadlines or stay on the road too long. TWU Vic/Tas Secretary Mike McNess said TWU members are devastated by the involvement of school children in recent crashes and are determined to make transport a safer industry. McNess added that while transport is one of Australia’s most essential industries, it is also its deadliest, with unchecked commercial pressure at the top of supply chains bearing down on operators and drivers who interface with other road users.

“Our thoughts are with the school children, their families and the drivers involved in these terrible incidents. The Victorian Government has importantly recognised truck crashes as workplace incidents, and we’re calling on WorkSafe to use that mandate to open up lines of inquiry into supply chain pressures on truck operators in these specific incidents and across transport in the state. No stone should be left unturned in investigating all factors that may have caused these incidents, and in unearthing the pressures on drivers that must be eradicated to prevent future crashes from occurring,” McNess said.

So far this year, 27 people have died in truck crashes in Victoria, including seven truck drivers. This comes as TWU makes representations to the state government about tightening state transport laws and while construction is taking place by the federal government into reform to set standards in transport.

99,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Australian Council of Trade Unions has revealed that big businesses are outsourcing labour in Australia at rapidly rising rates, undermining wages, job security and conditions in all industries. The practice is reportedly rife in aviation, mining, manufacturing and transport, as well as hospitality, agriculture, meat processing, security and cleaning. Approximately 600,000 workers (or 3.5 to 4.5% of the workforce) are employed through labour hire, according to research by the ACTU. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show growth in labour hire use and labour hire employees outpacing employment growth.

About 81% of labour-hire workers work full-time hours yet they do not have full-time jobs — their ongoing employment is insecure. Some 84% of labour hire workers do not have paid leave and most have no guaranteed minimum hours. They earn about $4700 a year less than ordinary workers when comparing the median hourly rate for a full-time worker, according to the ACTU.

Labour hire was originally intended to fill short-term gaps, but big businesses are now using complex, multi-tiered, opaque structures to outsource then re-source labour. This enables them to erode job security and avoid the wages and conditions set in awards or enterprise agreements. It means a labour-hire employee doing the same job alongside a direct hire can be paid much less. The ACTU said that this system is out of date, with big businesses exploiting loopholes to cut pay and circumvent secure jobs, all while CEO bonuses increase.

ACTU President Michele O’Neil said that when the labour hire industry has annual revenue of $30 billion to $40 billion, the workers’ wages are going backwards because businesses have worked out how to game the system to cut wages and job security.

“When two workers are working alongside each other and doing the same work, but one is on a much lower rate of pay because their employer has been ‘clever’ enough to use a different company to employ one of them, this is not fair. Two people working alongside each other doing the same job should get the same pay. Nothing could be simpler or fairer than that. The government must act to restore fairness. We need measures to ensure workers who do the same work are paid the same wages. If our laws are not updated to close the legal loopholes big business is using, workers and their families will continue struggling to keep their heads above water while big business posts soaring profits and CEO bonuses go up,” O’Neil said.","Approximately 600,000 workers (or 3.5 to 4.5% of the workforce) are employed through labour hire, according to research by the ACTU.

100,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Workplace safety inspectors arrived on the slopes of NSW snowfields as early snow fell across the alpine regions. The inspectors were there to ensure that workers and visitors alike enjoy the ski season in a safe work and recreation environment. SafeWork NSW launched the alpine ski area safety compliance program with an industry roundtable involving all snowfield operators to discuss the safe operation of passenger ropeways, including chairlifts and gondolas.

Following the roundtable, SafeWork NSW engineers visited Thredbo Kosciuszko, Perisher Blue, Charlotte Pass and the reopening Selwyn snowfields to inspect passenger ropeways and ensure there are appropriate protections around moving plant as well as induction and safety systems in place for itinerant workers in seasonal workplaces. It is a regulatory priority of SafeWork in 2023 to better protect seasonal workers by improving industry compliance with work health and safety obligations.

SafeWork NSW will continue to maintain this safety priority with inspectors scheduled to visit Perisher, Selwyn, Charlotte Pass and Thredbo throughout the rest of the snow season. Minister for Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis said protecting seasonal workers and improving WHS compliance is a SafeWork priority in 2023, with collaboration between the government, operators, their workers and the public key to realising this goal.

“The early snow was a nice surprise that will have workers, skiers and snowboarders excited for the season ahead. Our hardworking inspectors wasted no time arriving on the snowfields to meet with operators, inspect chairlifts and gondolas and ensure workers are appropriately trained. The beginning of the snow season is the busiest time of the year as thousands of workers move into these areas. We want business and workers to start the season with a safety-first attitude,” Cotsis said.

102,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A new study has tested technology-advanced training methods for construction workers, analysing the effectiveness of training delivered using virtual reality, compared to conventional (face-to-face) training methods. The three-year project involved a partnership of leading researchers from Queensland University of Technology (QUT), Construction Skills Queensland (CSQ) and Next World Enterprise, with support from several registered training operators.

Researchers tested the outcomes from a ‘Working safely at heights’ course delivered via a custom-built VRR simulation and compared these with the same training delivered via traditional means. The study showed VR training outcomes were comparable with traditional training for most questions when tested directly after training, with traditional training moderately more effective. However, at a retest after one month, retained learnings through VRR were comparable with retained learnings from face-to-face training.

CSQ CEO Brett Schimming said the study suggests VR may present a viable additional delivery method in future construction training. Schimming said the outcomes of the study provide an interesting case for training providers to further investigate emerging training technologies. “Technological advances are changing the face of all industries, and construction is no different — CSQ is interested in understanding how these changes may flow through, both to new skill requirements and new approaches to the delivery of training. Safety will remain paramount in all construction training conversations including considering the introduction of VR into the current training industry,” Schimming said.

Lead QUT researcher Associate Professor Kate Thompson said the study returned some interesting insights about VRR training in a construction setting as it did not rely on previous experience with VR. Around 60% of the VR trainees had never used the technology before but this VR experience provided them with a safe environment to learn in their own time, according to Thompson. “They could practise skills as many times as they liked before progressing to the next stage. It is a really exciting area to be researching as not all VR training environments are the same,” Thompson said.

Thompson added that an exciting outcome includes the establishment of guidelines to help people start VR environments that could be effective in training and skills development. Michael O’Reilly, a behavioural scientist and founder of Next World, said the real beauty of VR is that people can be put into simulated unsafe situations, in order to help them understand why the safety standards exist, in a safe manner. This creates a level of comprehension and emotional connection that leads to positive behavioural change.

“One significant implication of this study is that we can reduce learning duration with the addition of VR, without compromising learning outcomes. That is a game changer! Workplace training is increasingly blended, and VR is taking its place alongside the other modes, while increasingly being seen as a preferred option because of its power in learning outcome generation,” O’Reilly said.

CSQ currently runs a popular program in schools giving students an interactive VR experience of a construction worksite. “The use of VR has proven to be a successful vehicle for us as an engagement tool where our goal is to pique the interest of students in learning more about construction careers,” Schimming said.

103,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A Grattan Institute report has found that exploitation of migrant workers in Australia is rife, with lead author and Grattan Institute Economic Policy Program Director Brandan Coates saying “it’s got to stop”. The report shows that recent migrants are twice as likely as long-term residents to be underpaid, and up to 16% of recent migrants are paid less than the national minimum wage. “Exploitation hurts migrants, but it also weakens the bargaining power of Australian workers, harms businesses that do the right thing, damages our global reputation and undermines confidence in the migration program,” Coates said.

The Institute has called for three sets of reforms to eliminate exploitation, including the reform of visa rules that increase migrants’ risk of exploitation. Many temporary visa holders put up with mistreatment because they fear that if they speak up their visa will be cancelled or they will lose their pathway to permanent residency in Australia. Temporary skill-shortage visas should be made portable, so migrants can flee from an exploitative employer, with a new Workplace Justice visa created to empower workers to report exploitation and stay in Australia while they pursue unpaid wages.

Second, workplace and migration laws should be strengthened and better enforced to deter exploitation. Few employers who underpay their migrant workers get caught, and when they do get caught the penalties are too small, according to the Grattan Institute. The Fair Work Ombudsman hit employers with $4 million in penalties in 2021–22, whereas the ATO hit taxpayers with $3 billion in penalties and the ACCC imposed $232 million in penalties for breaches of competition and consumer law. The Grattan Institute has called for the FWO to be renamed the Workplace Rights Authority and given greater powers and more funding. Maximum court-ordered penalties against employers should be increased, with criminal penalties including jail applied where employers knowingly underpay workers.

Third, migrants should be given more help to reclaim lost wages, with Migrant Workers Centres established in each state, funding for community legal centres boosted and the Fair Entitlement Guarantee extended to migrant workers.

These reforms would cost $115 million a year. The Grattan Institute said this should be covered by a levy on select temporary visas set at $30 for each year of work rights the visa offers (raising $45 million a year) and by the larger penalties paid by employers who underpay their workers (at least $70 million a year).

“Exploitation of migrant workers — who are often young and vulnerable — is a blight on Australia’s claim to be the land of the fair go. Our report shows how the government can stamp it out,” Coates said.","A Grattan Institute report has found that exploitation of migrant workers in Australia is rife, with lead author and Grattan Institute Economic Policy Program Director Brandan Coates saying “it’s got to stop”.

If you own or manage a food business, a new, stricter food safety standard will come into effect 8 December 2023 — Standard 3.2.2A Food Safety Management Tools. Standard 3.2.2A is an extension of the Standard 3.2.2 Food Safety Requirements in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code), for food businesses identified as a Category One or Two that engage in high-risk food handling activities, which aims to improve food safety. The Standard applies to the vast majority of food service and food retail businesses, such as restaurants, cafés, pubs, hotels with table service, takeaway and smorgasbords; supermarkets and delis; takeaway shops, mobile food vendors and juice bars; hospitals, aged care facilities and childcare centres.

Restaurants and cafés are classified as a Category One Business and as such must implement all three Food Safety Management Tools to strengthen their management of hazards known to contribute to foodborne illness. These standards provide a risk-based, preventative approach to providing safe and suitable food which is based on the principle that food safety is best ensured by implementing food hygiene controls at each stage of food handling and implementation of additional risk management tools.

The newly released Pro-Visual AR Interactive – Restaurant & Café Guide to Managing Workplace & Food Safety 2023/24 produced in conjunction with Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), Food Safety Information Council (FSIC) and the NSCA Foundation features guidance on the new Standard 3.2.2A and Food Safety Management Tools Fact Sheets to assist businesses to implement all three Food Safety Management Tools based on food handling activities, in addition to existing obligations.

The program features AFL player and 2014 Australian of the Year Adam Goodes, Atlassian futurist Dominic Price, workplace injury victim and safety advocate Candice Carnahan, and CEO and business strategist Zipho Sikhakhane. Leaders and experts in work health and safety regulation, business and unions will travel from across the world to share knowledge, research and perspectives on the gig economy, emerging technologies, safety culture, psychosocial hazards and other key topics contributing to the protection of workers’ lives.

Australia’s World Congress will explore how business, governments and workers can ‘Shape Change’ in the evolving world of work and how to better protect people on the job through keynote presentations, symposia, roundtables, workshops and technical tours. The guest list includes attendees from Africa, the Arab States, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. The event will be jointly hosted by the International Labour Organisation, the International Social Security Association and SafeWork NSW, and will take place over four days from 27–30 November 2023 at Sydney’s International Convention Centre.

Head of SafeWork NSW Natasha Mann said the World Congress is a chance to share with the world what NSW is doing right and to learn ways to better protect workers.

“From emerging technology to mental health, experts from across the globe will collaborate together for a better future at work, look at the changing world of work and future-proof against new risks. This is an opportunity to create international connections, hear different perspectives, learn new skills and showcase Australian leadership in workplace health and safety,” Mann said.

Gilbert F. Houngbo, Secretary for the International Labour Organisation, said the event will serve as an excellent opportunity to share and exchange knowledge and experience, as well as chart a course to tackle existing and newly emerging issues regarding the safety, health and wellbeing of all. “After the unprecedented global health crisis caused by COVID-19, the world has realised that a human-centred, inclusive, resilient and sustainable recovery is not possible without sound national occupational safety and health standards, policies and infrastructures,” Houngbo said.

Australia’s World Congress will explore how business, governments and workers can ‘Shape Change’ in the evolving world of work and how to better protect people on the job through keynote presentations, symposia, roundtables, workshops and technical tours.
The event will be jointly hosted by the International Labour Organisation, the International Social Security Association and SafeWork NSW, and will take place over four days from 27–30 November 2023 at Sydney’s International Convention Centre.
Head of SafeWork NSW Natasha Mann said the World Congress is a chance to share with the world what NSW is doing right and to learn ways to better protect workers.
This is an opportunity to create international connections, hear different perspectives, learn new skills and showcase Australian leadership in workplace health and safety,” Mann said.",,https://www.nscafoundation.org.au/news
106,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A Monash University-led initiative to improve early screening and detection of silicosis, an incurable and deadly occupational lung disease caused by breathing silica dust, has received a funding boost. Associate Professor Jane Bourke, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute’s (BDI) Head of Respiratory Pharmacology, has been awarded funding totalling $416,000 across two research projects on silicosis.

The first reported case of engineered stone-induced silicosis in Australia was in 2015 and reported cases have since risen to more than 600 cases by 2022. It is expected that there will eventually be more than 100,000 cases of silicosis across Australia. Silicosis reportedly affects an estimated one in four engineered stoneworkers, as well as miners and tunnellers. When they cut, crush, drill or polish materials that contain silica, such as engineered stone benchtops or natural sandstone, this generates silica dust. The silica particles are so small that they lodge deep in the lungs and cause inflammation and irreversible scarring, which results in declining lung function.

The first project, awarded by the Victorian Medical Research Acceleration Fund (VMRAF) for $93,500 in 2023, will look at early screening of people to see if they have chemical signatures representing silicosis. The second, funded by the Dust Diseases Board of NSW (DDB) through icare for $322,500 across 2023–2025, is for testing of therapeutic agents which can ameliorate or prevent progression of lung scarring characteristic of silicosis.

Bourke said that at present, only people with symptoms are presenting to hospitals, which means many more may be developing disease but not know about it. “What usually happens during a disease process involving inhaled foreign substances is that immune system cells in the body can detect and destroy them. Unfortunately, this defence mechanism isn’t helpful when exposed to silica dust because silica cannot be destroyed or removed. Silica remains in the lungs and causes constant and persistent inflammation and lung scarring. What we’re planning to do is obtain a unique biochemical profile of this response to silica, to develop a signature of ‘biomarkers’ in exhaled breath. We want to make sure that workers are aware of the dangers of silica dust and provide them with the best chance to catch potential lung disease early, before irreversible damage has occurred,” Bourke said.

A non-invasive test that is simple to administer will enable population-based screening programs, the next step in dealing with silicosis. Therapeutics that can reverse lung scarring caused by the disease are also vital. Bourke’s research project is one of those selected for funding by the DDB to investigate various potential therapeutic agents for silicosis. Annually, the DDB funds research and other activities into the causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of dust diseases to reduce risks and improve outcomes for those whose lives are impacted.

“In silicosis, the inhaled silica particles cause irritation and damage when they lodge deep in the lungs. The body then generates collagen, which damages the lungs and goes on to form scar tissue, or fibrosis, and eventually, lung function is compromised. We plan to test a number of drugs to reverse the scarring, so there won’t be a fatal build-up of scar tissue,” Bourke said.

Bourke said that the research team has developed a model for specifically testing silicosis drugs in human tissue. The researchers will take microscopic slices of tissue from human lungs, donated but not used for transplantation. They will then be exposed to silica dust and inflammatory protein cocktails found in the lungs of silicosis patients to cause lung damage and scarring — this will mimic the environment in the silicotic lung. “Then we can test two anti-fibrotic drugs (already approved and shown to be effective in another lung disease) and two promising novel in-house drugs to target inflammation and fibrosis in silicosis,” Bourke said.

Professor Rob Widdop, who collaborates with Bourke on other lung-related projects, said that it is imperative that effective diagnostics and treatments for lung disease are developed. “Jane has not only been at the forefront of research in this area for many years, but she has also worked closely and extensively with those impacted by the disease, advocating for sector-wide changes,” Widdop said.

107,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has launched an awareness campaign about the stigma associated with workers compensation and what can be done to reduce it. Research from the National Return to Work Survey 2021 found that one in three workers thought they would be treated differently by people at work if they knew about their injury or illness, and one in five workers were worried about the stigma associated with being on workers compensation.

Workers compensation stigma can prevent injured or ill workers from making a workers compensation claim and it can also impact their recovery. It has negative impacts for the worker’s team and the organisation more broadly, lowering morale and productivity. Developed in collaboration with Safe Work Australia Members, the new resources provide practical information for employers, supervisors and workers about workers compensation and what can be done to reduce stigma around it.

The workers compensation stigma campaign is an initiative under the National Return to Work Strategy 2020–2030 that aims to improve return to work outcomes for ill and injured workers. Safe Work Australia does not administer workers compensation schemes or manage workers compensation claims — this is the responsibility of the Commonwealth, states and territories, who manage their own workers compensation arrangements.

Safe Work Australia Chief Executive Officer Michelle Baxter said workers compensation provides an important safety net to support people who become ill or injured because of work; it also provide financial support and other assistance so workers can focus on getting back to work safely.

“One of the most important factors contributing to a worker’s recovery and safe return to work is whether they have a supportive and inclusive work environment. This campaign will build awareness of workers compensation stigma and provide practical resources to help employers, supervisors and workers to understand what they can do to reduce it. Everyone can play a role to create a workplace where injured or ill workers are supported and protected from experiencing workers compensation stigma,” Baxter said.

Safe Work Australia Chair Joanne Farrell said supporting ill or injured workers to get back to work safely benefits everyone — the worker, their team and the broader organisation. “By understanding what workers compensation stigma is, where it can occur, and how to identify it, we can take action to reduce it,” Farrell said.

108,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"As the cost of living continues to rise, a new report has revealed that more than half of gig economy workers in the UK are paid below the minimum wage. The study, led by the University of Bristol, found 52% of gig workers doing jobs ranging from data entry to food delivery were earning below the minimum wage. On average, respondents were earning £8.97 per hour — around 15% below the current UK minimum wage, which rose to £10.42 in May 2023. Approximately 76% of survey respondents also experienced work-related insecurity and anxiety.

Lead author Dr Alex Wood said the research findings highlight that working in the UK gig economy often entails low pay, anxiety and stress. “As food, fuel and housing costs keep rising, this group of workers are especially vulnerable and need to be more adequately remunerated and better protected,” Wood said.

More than a quarter (28%) of survey respondents felt they were risking their health or safety in doing gig work and 25% experienced pain on the job. When asked what would improve their situation, basic rights such as minimum wage rates, holiday and sick pay, and protection against unfair dismissal were most wanted. Unions and platform councils to represent their needs and help influence how gig economy platforms operate and affect their working conditions also featured on their wish list. More than three-quarters of respondents believe the introduction of such bodies will bring immediate benefits.

According to Wood, a major factor contributing to low pay rates is that this work involves spending significant amounts of time waiting or looking for work while logged on to a platform — the work is low paid and also extremely insecure and risky. “The self-employed who are dependent on platforms to make a living are urgently in need of labour protections to shield them against the huge power asymmetries that exist in the sector. This clearly warrants the expansion of the current ‘worker’ status to protect them,” Wood said.

The study surveyed 510 UK gig economy workers in 2022, with representation from across the sector. Half the respondents were remote freelancers using platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr to pick up jobs ranging from data entry to website design. The other half comprised local drivers providing food delivery and taxi services via platforms including Deliveroo and Uber. Respondents spent an average of 28 hours a week undertaking gig work, comprising 60% of their total earnings.

Respondents considered their work to be best described as self-employment and thought an extension of labour rights to include the self-employed would significantly improve their working lives. The survey findings suggest strong support for European-style co-determination whereby worker representatives are consulted on and approve changes that impact working conditions and employment. Work councils that exist in countries like Germany could therefore provide a model for platform councils and assemblies in the gig economy to facilitate workers having a say over the decisions that affect their ability to make a living.

Brendan Burchell, co-author of the report, said respondents felt that the creation of co-determination mechanisms would allow workers and their representatives to influence platform provider decisions which could improve their working lives. “These policies include elected bodies of worker representatives approving all major platform changes that impact jobs and working conditions. Our findings emphasise the potential for trade union growth in this sector, with majorities being willing to join and even organise such bodies,” Burchell said.

109,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Transport Workers’ Union of Australia has launched a national campaign to lift standards in the waste collection industry, after Cleanaway workers walked off the job for 24 hours on Wednesday 17 May 2023 in Sydney and Victoria. Waste workers have reportedly faced persistent attacks to pay and conditions by Cleanaway management across the country. The strikes followed multiple others in NSW, Queensland, WA and the ACT as workers face attempts by Cleanaway to strip back overtime entitlements and extend rosters, forcing workers to work weekends for less take-home pay. Cleanaway recently announced a $49 million half-year profit after tax.

In 2022, the Supreme Court found Cleanaway guilty on two health and safety breaches over a 2014 SA truck crash that killed two people, on the basis it had failed to adequately train and supervise the driver, who was also badly injured in the crash and had already been cleared of charges. The TWU has also filed a dispute in the Federal Court over Cleanaway breaching its obligations to provide information to workers and the Fair Work Commission for a protected action ballot, which delayed workers’ accessing their rights. In 2022 the TWU successfully fought for the reinstatement of a delegate and elected worker bargaining representative who was unfairly sacked by the company.

The Queensland Department of Environment and Science has laid 12 charges against Cleanaway for environmental offences carrying a maximum total penalty of $36.5 million; the matter will be addressed at the Ipswich Magistrates Court on 24 April 2023.

The TWU said Cleanaway’s local government clients have a responsibility to ensure waste workers have fair and reasonable working conditions to ensure waste services can run smoothly and residential streets are safe. City of Sydney Mayor Clover Moore has previously refused workers’ requests to meet to help reach a fair agreement.

The NSW safety regulator is investigating a workplace death at Cleanaway, Badgerys Creek, in which a worker was found “wedged between machinery” in February 2022. Another driver was killed in 2022 when his Cleanaway truck rolled on the Stuart Highway. Six people have died in crashes involving Cleanaway trucks in Australia since 2011.

TWU NSW/Qld Secretary Richard Olsen said that Cleanaway has engaged in conduct that hinders good-faith negotiations for too long, and has continued to attempt to push these essential workers’ pay and conditions backwards. “We have continued to stand strong against their attempts to rush through a bad deal, and will continue to push back. We will not accept an agreement which continues to hurt hundreds of hardworking families. Our members don’t want to continue to take protected action and continue to inconvenience their community, but the council continues to fail to intervene, which can only be seen as an endorsement of Cleanaway’s behaviour,” Olsen said.

TWU Vic/Tas Secretary Mike McNess said that instead of attempting to send workers backwards, Cleanaway should step up and deliver a fair deal to essential waste workers who communities and businesses rely on. “These workers are facing attacks by Cleanaway to their overtime, pay and conditions in Victoria and right across the country. We are living through a cost-of-living crisis and essential waste workers should not have to be fighting to maintain their wages and conditions. The TWU is calling on Cleanaway to clean up their act and refocus on a fair deal for workers,” McNess said.

110,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Researchers from Monash University have developed a personalised app to improve the sleep and mood of vital shift workers. During the pandemic, shift workers kept the nation functioning and helped many of us survive its deadly effects. Now, researchers from the Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health have developed SleepSync, an app that personalises sleep-wake cycles for shift workers to improve their sleep and overall mood. The research, led by Dr Jade Murray, is published in Digital Health.

The research saw 27 shift workers trial the app over a two-week period; mainly intensive care and emergency department nurses at high risk of shift work disorder, commonly experienced as insomnia and excessive sleepiness. SleepSync improved total sleep time, ability to fall asleep, sleep quality and perception of recovery on days off. With the app considering each individual’s daily routine, 70% reported it was easier to fall asleep, and more than 80% reported better quality sleep. Participants also slept an average of 29 minutes longer each night.

Murray said that the app aims to aid behavioural change and provide practical advice to shift workers by providing personalised sleep scheduling recommendations and education. “This has the potential to improve shift workers’ health and wellbeing and how they function day-to-day. It also has the potential for development and integration with wearable devices, such as smart watches, and to further help minimise the health costs associated with shift work to society,” Murray said.

SleepSync, a mobile phone app, is unique because it is tailored to the individual user by incorporating a calendar for work and personal commitments; providing biologically viable recommendations for sleep timing that account for work and social obligations based on the information users enter into the calendar, such as work shifts and important personal activities; and daily logging of actual sleep-wake times and mood. Users receive a ‘recovery score’ based on their level of adherence to the recommended sleep times.

Murray said work hours outside the nine to five regime play havoc with the body’s circadian clock, with shift workers reporting an increased functional impact of sleep disturbance and misalignment, including impaired alertness and increased sleepiness during wakefulness compared to the general population. “Shift workers are also at greater risk of a range of long-term adverse health consequences such as gastrointestinal problems, cardiovascular disease, mood disorders and cancer, as well as the short-term increase in the risk of errors, accidents and injuries,” Murray said.

To date, helping a shift worker to sleep well has largely relied on workplace interventions such as adjusting workplace lighting, scheduled workplace napping, sleep hygiene programs, wellness programs and workplace fatigue management programs. Co-author Dr Tracey Sletten said individual workers needed evidence-backed ways to optimise their sleep around their work schedule. According to Sletten, 67% of participants reported how influential SleepSync was for modifying their behaviour and habits, while 82% found the app easy to incorporate into their daily lives. Users also reported improvements in mood (depression, anxiety and stress), insomnia symptom severity, sleep hygiene and sleep-related daytime impairments. “Each person has different underlying biology and specific work patterns, which need to be accommodated in a personalised schedule to help them sleep better,” Sletten said.

The sharp reduction in exports to mainland China following the imposition of significant deposit tariffs, the ongoing impact of COVID-19, environmental stressors such as floods and hailstorms, conflict in Eastern Europe, rising inflation and capacity issues following a record vintage have created the perfect storm of challenges for the wine industry sector.

On a positive note, towards the end of the 2021–22 financial year have seen the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the United States (US) dollar which assists in making Australian wine more price competitive, particularly in the US market.

In response to these myriad challenges, Mental Health & Wellbeing is a primary focus of the newly released AR Interactive — Wine Producers Guide to Safety 2023 produced in conjunction with industry partnering Association Australian Grape & Wine and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation to provide tools and resources to enable those persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBU) to take a prevention-led strategic approach to managing mental health and wellbeing, and build capacity for a productive mentally healthy workplace that supports workers and helps break the stigma and discrimination that often surround this topic.

This focus is particularly in light of the model work health and safety (WHS) laws which now include regulations on psychosocial hazards and a new model Code of Practice Managing Psychosocial Hazards at Work. This guide is an overview of the Australian mental health workforce policy landscape, which varies across jurisdictions, however has commonalities in its aims and principles, as mental injury claims continue to increase.

112,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Chamber Wellness Program is a collaboration between the Queensland Government and Business Chamber Queensland to provide support to chambers of commerce and their business networks across Queensland. The program includes the Chamber Wellness Fund and the Business Chamber Queensland online mental health resources for chambers. Chambers from Cairns, Mt Isa and Gold Coast will receive funding of up to $5000 to support small businesses in their local area.

Commerce North West (Mt Isa) will host a Workplace Wellness event to share knowledge and skills related to self-care, stress reduction and healthy living. The Valley Chamber of Commerce, Spring Hill will run meditation sessions followed by breakfast, teaching the importance of relaxation in a busy lifestyle. The LIVINWell Southern Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce project will address the need for small business owners and their staff to feel that they can ask for help and how to ask for help with mental health concerns affecting them, their colleagues or families. The project will educate members on the signs that may indicate they need help and will give them solutions about what to do next. The Sunshine Coast Chambers to receive funding include Nambour, Yandina, Eumundi, Noosa, Caloundra and Marooychydore.

Minister for Employment and Small Business Di Farmer said running a small business can be very rewarding but it can also take its toll on the business owners and employees — when the business is under stress. Farmer said the Chamber Wellness Program will equip local chambers with the skills and resources to tailor mental health wellness initiatives to local small business owners and operators in their region.

“Programs through the package include the appointment of six specialist business wellness coaches across Queensland where they are needed most (Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, North Brisbane, South Brisbane, Toowoomba). Each coach has up to 28 clients at any one time. Interactions with those clients each month can range from physical visits, telephone support as well as support to access other services. Some clients may not need much support for the duration of the engagement with a coach and others will need intensive assistance requiring multiple hours of work,” Farmer said.

Business Chamber Queensland CEO Heidi Cooper said mental health and wellness is a significant priority for Queensland businesses and their workforces with many businesses identifying mental health as a significant issue for workforces going forward.

“It’s why the Chamber Wellness Program is such an important asset for chambers across the state and also the local business communities and workforces which rely on them. This program means chambers can take positive steps to look after, connect and support their business community. Local chambers have a really important role to play in their business communities and we’re so pleased to work with the Queensland Government to empower chambers to promote positive mental health and wellbeing among businesses in every part of Queensland,” Cooper said.

113,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Food delivery workers are at risk of physical and psychological harm at work. Safe Work Australia has launched the ‘Deliver yourself home safely’ campaign to increase the awareness and knowledge of work health and safety for food delivery workers. Safe Work Australia data shows there have been 10 fatalities of food delivery workers since 2019. This is a devastating outcome for these workers and their families, friends and co-workers, as well as the broader community.

The ‘Deliver yourself home safely’ campaign provides food delivery workers with practical information and key contact details to help influence positive work health and safety attitudes and behaviours. Due to the high proportion of food delivery workers who have English as a second language, the campaign will communicate in Mandarin, Punjabi, Nepali, Vietnamese, Hindi and Urdu. All materials will also be available in English.

The campaign website has information on work health and safety risks and hazards, rights and duties, what food delivery workers can do to keep safe, dealing with abuse and extreme weather conditions, work health and safety consultation, and workers’ compensation. The campaign kit has posters, checklists, social media tiles, infographics and fact sheets.

The campaign complements national work health and safety guidance for the food delivery industry published by Safe Work Australia in 2021 to help food delivery riders, platforms and food outlets understand and comply with their duties under work health and safety legislation, identify and manage the relevant risks and hazards and understand how workers’ compensation applies to the gig economy.

Michelle Baxter, Chief Executive Officer of Safe Work Australia, said that all workers, regardless of the work they do or how they are engaged, have a right to a healthy and safe working environment. This includes food delivery workers who encounter a range of hazards in their jobs that pose risks to physical and psychological safety. “It’s important food delivery workers understand what they can do to be safe at work, as well as who they can talk to about work health and safety, so they can get home safely. They are, after all, the most valuable package,” Baxter said.

114,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Outdoor workers are reportedly exposed to three times more UV radiation than indoor workers, with the Cancer Institute NSW urging people to take action to reduce their skin cancer risk. The Cancer Institute NSW’s new ‘Change Your Routine’ video campaign warns of the dangers of skin cancer, with supportive resources for workers and employers that model how, when and where to protect their skin at work.

The Chief Cancer Officer for NSW and CEO of Cancer Institute NSW, Professor Tracey O’Brien, said that although UV may not be seen or felt, it is ever-present, even on cool and cloudy days. “It’s a misconception that UV radiation is only harmful during summer, with high UV index levels present in NSW from August to May,” O’Brien said.

According to O’Brien, 95% of melanoma and 99% of non-melanoma skin cancers are caused by overexposure to UV radiation from the sun, and for those working in agriculture, construction and roads, the risk of developing skin cancer is even greater. “Fortunately, most skin cancers can be prevented if we follow the advice that has been drummed into us for decades — when outdoors, slip on protective clothing, slop on SPF 50+ sunscreen, slap on a wide brimmed hat, seek shade and slide on sunglasses. It can truly save lives,” O’Brien said.

Australia reportedly has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world, with two out of three Australians treated for skin cancer during their lifetime. Not all skin cancers can simply be cut out, with men over 40 years of age 2.5 times more likely to die from melanoma than women of the same age. Professor O’Brien said UV radiation is a major workplace hazard and employers have a duty of care to protect their workers.

“There are simple measures employers can take to protect their staff, like setting up shade areas using gazebos or awnings, attaching sun protection to helmets, providing employees with sunscreen and breathable full-length work wear, and ensuring workers follow other sun safety measures,” O’Brien said.

Construction worker Corey Jane, 29, has had 20 skin cancers removed from almost every part of his body. He urged fellow outdoor workers to make sun protection part of their daily routine. “My attitude towards sun safety since my diagnosis has changed drastically. It’s not uncool to be the person with the big hat, the sunglasses, the long sleeve shirts, because at the end of the day, that person has a better chance of living a longer, healthier life,” Jane said.

The Minister for Health, Ryan Park, said the campaign will be hitting the airwaves and reaching out to workers and employers online, to dispel myths about the risks of skin cancer as well as provide simple and practical steps for workers and their employers to take to prevent it. The Minister for Work Health and Safety, Sophie Cotsis, urged employers and workers to make checking the UV index part of their morning routine before heading to work.

“If it’s high, then cover up and protect yourself. It only takes a few minutes to protect yourself from the harmful UV rays and it could save you a lifetime of battling skin cancer. Worker health and safety isn’t just about hardhats and harnesses, it is also about sun protection and avoiding overexposure to UV on the job,” Cotsis said.

The general rule is to protect your skin from the sun when the UV index is high, at 3 or above. Daily UV index levels can be monitored on the MyUV site. More information about the Change Your Routine campaign can be found here.

“It’s a misconception that UV radiation is only harmful during summer, with high UV index levels present in NSW from August to May,” O’Brien said.
Australia reportedly has one of the highest skin cancer rates in the world, with two out of three Australians treated for skin cancer during their lifetime.
Professor O’Brien said UV radiation is a major workplace hazard and employers have a duty of care to protect their workers.

115,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Spinal Health Week is the annual national campaign aimed at improving the spinal health of Australians of all ages, taking place from 22–28 May 2023. Conducted by the Australian Chiropractors Association (ACA), the 2023 campaign will focus on the causes of headaches and the negative effects headaches are having on families, workers and the Australian economy.

With more than seven million Australians suffering from debilitating tension headaches, and more than 4.9 million suffering chronic migraine, the economic impact to Australia exceeds $35.7 billion annually. However, the real cost to headache sufferers is the burden of headaches impacting their quality of life — robbing sufferers of essential relaxation, social activities and time with family and friends, as well as limiting productivity at home, work and school.

Migraine and tension headaches are the most common headache disorders, but there are many types of headaches and many triggers that can cause them, with some of the most common causes being stress (at home, work and school) and spinal health conditions. Headaches relating to spinal health conditions can be cervicogenic (neck-related) while tension headaches and migraines can be triggered by neck and spinal problems.

Consulting a chiropractor and determining if headaches are related to spinal health problems is an important step in effective management of most headaches with the best outcomes being a holistic approach encompassing stress management, good posture, regular exercise, rest and a healthy diet.

During national Spinal Health Week 2023, the ACA will tackle spine-related headaches by increasing awareness of the painful condition and improving spinal health through effective drug-free solutions that limit the impact headaches have on the quality of life of over 46% of Australians.

117,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The NSW Minister for Work Health and Safety Sophie Cotsis has urged businesses and workers to follow forklift safety guidelines, after 1538 serious forklift-related incidents were reported in the past five years. Between 2017 and 2022, there were also five deaths in NSW involving forklifts.

Incidents involving forklifts include collisions, rollovers and objects falling off forklifts — these incidents often have serious and life-changing consequences. To keep people safe, SafeWork NSW inspectors will visit businesses to check on forklift compliance and provide education on issues including licensing, traffic management, seatbelts and forklift safety. SafeWork NSW is also offering rebates of up to $1000 through its Small Business Rebate Program to enable local small businesses to implement safety improvements.

Cotsis said that safety should be the number one priority for anyone operating a forklift, because everyone deserves to get home at the end of the day. “The Minns Labor government is hitting the ground running to make NSW a safer place for workers. We are focused on solutions that foster a health and safety standard workers expect and deserve,” Cotsis said.

SafeWork Ambassador Mark Ellis, who was struck by a forklift at his NSW workplace and consequently had his leg amputated above the knee, added that there is no job so important that it can’t be done safely. “My message is very simple and an important one. Think about safety before you operate a forklift, check the area is clear of pedestrians, that the load is secure, and you have enough room,” Ellis said.

Further information on forklift safety, including safety videos and fact sheets, can be found here.

118,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"SafeWork SA inspectors have started conducting site audits as part of a campaign aimed at measuring awareness of sexual harassment, discrimination and violence at South Australian mine sites. SafeWork SA launched the campaign late last year with a workshop for senior managers and safety representatives from major SA mines to share information and gain a deeper understanding of industry best practice.

Two inspectors travelled to the Prominent Hill mine in the far north of the state and spoke with managers, supervisors and workers at the copper/gold mine. The mine is owned by OZ Minerals, with mining contractors Byrnecut Australia and Theiss conducting mining and transport activities on the site. Staff from all three organisations were included in the audit. Workers involved ranged from a new employee who had only been at the site for two weeks through to staff who had worked at the mine since it opened in 2009. This visit was the first in a series of audits being conducted by SafeWork SA at mine sites across the state.

SafeWork SA has also published fresh guidance on its website outlining mine operator and industry stakeholder obligations under the Work Health and Safety Act 2012 and potential control measures required to manage inappropriate behaviours. The Prominent Hill audit included questions about the site’s adherence to psychosocial issues including camp safety, bullying and sexual harassment. Managers and supervisors were also questioned about the provision of training and the procedures in place to handle complaints and other issues raised at the site.

Andrew Mooney, General Manager (Prominent Hill), said OZ Minerals prioritises the safety, health and wellbeing of its workforce; this includes ensuring the work environment is physically and psychologically safe and that everyone feels respected and included. “We welcome SafeWork SA’s audit and are pleased that Prominent Hill has been selected to be among the early participants. We look forward to sharing learnings that will help us continue to build a culture of care and respect,” Mooney said.

SafeWork SA Executive Director Glenn Farrell said the mining industry was chosen as the focus for the campaign because of the isolated nature of FIFO work, the unique mix of workers it engages, and issues identified in larger mining sites. Farrell said that every workplace needs to control the risk of inappropriate behaviours towards workers that can lead to psychological injury.

“Sexual harassment, discrimination and violence is firmly a work health and safety risk, as well as a crime under other legislation. This audit is an important step in the campaign that aims to set benchmarks and expectations around workplace culture in the mining industry,” Farrell said.

Major mining company Rio Tinto released its Report into Workplace Culture at Rio Tinto in February 2022. The report found that bullying was systemic within the company and sexual harassment occurred at unacceptable rates. The Enough is Enough report, tabled in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly in June 2022, found that sexual harassment against women in the FIFO mining industry represented “a failure of the industry to protect its workers”.

119,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Researchers at QUT have developed a tool to measure customer aggression within the retail and services sectors. Retail workers have reported increased incidents of abusive and aggressive customer behaviour, with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association survey finding 80% of retail employees have experienced customer abuse. The QUT-led study, published in Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services, identified the types of aggressive behaviours that employees face, and how these behaviours lead to employees’ emotional exhaustion, job stress and intention to leave.

The research involved five studies, including surveys of 211 undergraduate students who worked in frontline retail and service roles, and surveys of over 1000 Australian frontline retail and service employees. Lead author Professor Gary Mortimer said while incidents such as a customer violently throwing a product at an employee or yelling to attain a discount are clearly visible, aggression can also be subtle or implied. “Participants in the study indicated aggressive behaviour with examples of being stood over, stared at, being ignored or having fake poor reviews and negative comments posted on social media,” Mortimer said.

The study identified a four-factor customer aggression scale that listed 19 items for managers to use to survey staff. Mortimer said it is an easy-to-administer measurement tool to assess the extent and type of aggression that employees face.

“Once employees are surveyed and the data analysed, managers identify what types of aggression are more prevalent in their businesses, the staff who are more exposed to these hostile behaviours, and where these behaviours are more likely to occur. As an outcome, managers may implement mitigation strategies, like increasing the number of supervisors at checkout areas or installing video surveillance at refund or return counters. It is also important for companies to manage these types of risks to employees’ safety under work health and safety laws,” Mortimer said.

The study was co-authored by QUT’s Dr Shasha Wang and Mexico-based Professor Maria Lucila Osorio Andrade from EGADE Business School Technologico de Monterrey. “Businesses that introduce targeted mitigation strategies to reduce the harm on employees eventually improve employee wellbeing,” Wang said.

The study indicated that increasing abusive behaviour is the result of ‘displaced aggression’ toward retail and service employees. “The saying that the ‘customer is always right’ is known as ‘customer sovereignty’ and sovereignty relates to perceived relational ‘superiority’. It has been theorised that customer aggression results when ‘customer enchantment’ turns to ‘disillusionment’,” Mortimer said.

The research coincides with recent calls from the Australian Retailers Association and the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association for state and territory governments to implement tougher penalties for people who assault retail workers. South Australia strengthened its laws to a maximum penalty of five years’ prison for people convicted of basic assault against a retail worker while a New South Wales Labor election promise included harsher penalties.

120,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A new study published in Fish and Fisheries has found that gender-based violence, including labour and human rights abuses, unsafe working and living conditions for children, women and men, and the cultural acceptance of various forms of discrimination, is prevalent in the fisheries industry.

UN Women defines gender-based violence as any act of violence against a person or group of individuals based on their gender, and includes physical, sexual, emotional, verbal and psychological threats; harassment; coercion; or any other deprivations of liberty. Globally, there has been increased attention on understanding and integrating gender dimensions in fisheries. However, the intersection between fisheries and gender-based violence has received less attention.

To better understand the issue, four gender and fisheries experts conducted a global review of capture fisheries and identified five types of gender-based violence — physical, sexual, psychological, economic and cultural violence. Dr Sangeeta Mangubhai, an Industry Fellow at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), said the term ‘gender-based’ is used when violence is shaped by gender roles and expectations, power and status in society. Mangubhai said that there is a general misconception that gender-based violence is not relevant to fisheries or a topic that practitioners have a responsibility to address.

The study argues that gender-based violence cannot be separated from other actions taken to achieve equitable social outcomes through fisheries management, and therefore it is incumbent on fisheries practitioners and policy makers to address this in their sector.

“If those working in fisheries are not aware of how gender-based violence can occur in their sector, they can unintentionally reinforce or perpetuate different forms of violence through policies and practices,” said Kate Barclay, UTS Professor and co-author of the study.

The study provides seven recommendations to help work towards addressing gender-based violence in capture fisheries. The recommendations are to remove gender blindness and bias by investing in gender-sensitisation of the sector, improve policy and coordination between regulatory bodies especially in the areas of prevention and protection, form strategic partnerships with organisations with expertise in gender-based violence, and increase investments in labour rights and laws to protect those working in capture fisheries throughout the value chains. The study also recommends the design and implementation of gender integrative programmes, and investments in specific programs for the empowerment of women and programs for men seeking healthy models of masculinity.

The study finds that gender-based violence is not a standalone topic and should be dealt with in conjunction with other pressing issues such as resource depletion, climate change, poverty and unemployment. Holistic and interconnected fisheries is an opportunity for the sector to contribute to the sustainable development goals.

The research was conducted through a collaboration with the UTS Climate, Society and Environment Research Centre (C-SERC). In starting a conversation among practitioners and researchers about gender-based violence in fisheries, this study aligns with C-SERC and UTS’s agenda of pursuing social justice in research.

121,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A coalition of human rights organisations and academics has released a research report revealing the results of a survey of nearly 90 business groups on the impact of Australia’s Modern Slavery Act. The study used both survey and focus groups to examine business responses to modern slavery in Australia.

The report found that 70% of survey participants support the establishment of an Anti-Slavery Commissioner, while 67% said they would find it easier to comply with the Modern Slavery Act if it were harmonised with international standards such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 61% also said that they would likely improve modern slavery responses if required to undertake human rights due diligence. The report also found that 54% would likely improve modern slavery responses if financial penalties were introduced.

Professor Justine Nolan, Director of the Australian Human Rights Institute and a Professor in the Faculty of Law & Justice at UNSW Sydney, said the research revealed a wide gap between a company’s paper promises and implementing changes in practice. “Business is generally supportive of levelling the playing field so that reforms to the Modern Slavery Act will drive more substantive responses to prevent and remedy modern slavery,” Nolan said.

The research investigated company approaches to remedying modern slavery in supply chains and found that failing to engage stakeholders presents a barrier to remediating modern slavery. It also found that increased transparency between companies and their suppliers would result in more effective remediation practices. RMIT Associate Professor Shelley Marshall said the survey and focus groups showed a strong appetite from business for reform of the Australian Modern Slavery Act and a desire for more government support and action with the creation of an Anti-Slavery Commissioner.

“Although the Modern Slavery Act is driving awareness of the importance for Australian business of addressing modern slavery in operations and supply chains, it is not yet improving the conditions of workers or remediating instances of modern slavery,” Marshall said.

The human rights groups have called on the government to strengthen the legislation by requiring companies to undertake due diligence to prevent and address modern slavery in their operations and supply chains; introducing penalties for companies that fail to comply with the Act; and ensuring appropriate enforcement of the Act by appointing an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. Freya Dinshaw from the Human Rights Law Centre said the survey findings show strong support from business for strengthening the Modern Slavery Act, as there is “little evidence” that the law is driving meaningful action by companies to lift conditions for supply chain workers at high risk of exploitation.

“In order to be more effective, the Act should be amended to require companies to take action to address modern slavery risks rather than just reporting on their current practices. There must be penalties for companies that fail to comply, and robust oversight and enforcement by an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. We urge the government to use the current statutory review to make these key reforms to strengthen the law,” Dinshaw said.

This is the third report released in a multi-year collaborative project evaluating company responses to Australia’s modern slavery reporting regime, and follows earlier reports Broken Promises and Paper Promises. The Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) is currently under a three-year statutory review led by Professor John McMillan, which ended on 31 March 2023. The review will be released publicly in coming weeks. The research was carried out by academics from the Australian Human Rights Institute at UNSW Sydney, the Business and Human Rights Centre (RMIT), the University of Melbourne, the University of Notre Dame Australia, the University of Western Australia and Willamette University, together with the Human Rights Law Centre and the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre.

122,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Food safety is especially important in school canteens since children can be more susceptible to foodborne illnesses. Food Standards Australia New Zealand and the Australian National University in 2022 estimated there are 4.67 million cases of foodborne illnesses in Australia each year that resulted in 47,900 hospitalisations and 38 deaths.

Food service, caterer and related food retail businesses, such as school canteens, need to meet a new stricter food safety standard that will come into effect 8 December 2023 — Standard 3.2.2A Food Safety Management Tools. Standard 3.2.2A is an extension of the Standard 3.2.2 Food Safety Requirements in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code), for food businesses identified as a Category One or Two that engage in high-risk food handling activities, which aims to improve food safety. The Standard applies to businesses in food service that handle unpackaged, potentially hazardous food that is ready to eat.

School canteens are classified as a Category One Business and as such must implement all three Food Safety Management Tools to strengthen their management of hazards known to contribute to foodborne illness. These standards provide a risk-based, preventative approach to providing safe and suitable food which is based on the principle that food safety is best ensured by implementing food hygiene controls at each stage of food handling, and implementation of additional risk management tools.

The newly released Pro-Visual AR Interactive — School Canteen Guide to Food Safety & Nutrition 2023/24, produced in conjunction with Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), Food Safety Information Council (FSIC) and the NSCA Foundation, features guidance on the new Standard 3.2.2A and Food Safety Management Tools Fact Sheets for implementation of all three Food Safety Management Tools based on food handling activities, in addition to existing obligations. The three tools are food safety supervisor, mandatory food handler training and substantiation of critical food safety controls.

123,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A report from the University of Melbourne Work Futures Hallmark Research Initiative has revealed that Australian workers are exhausted, unwell, at risk of quitting and largely unprepared for future workplace challenges driven by automation and artificial intelligence. The survey of 1400 Australian workers fielded in June 2022 asked about their experiences at work since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The findings, published in the 2023 State of the Future of Work Report, revealed that Australian workers were in poorer physical and mental health since the pandemic began, with workers aged between 25 and 55 years of age significantly impacted, one-third of these having considered quitting. Report co-author and sociologist Dr Brendan Churchill said Australian workplaces must prioritise workers’ well-being into the recovery to provide greater support in addressing burnout and mental distress. “With high rates of fatigue and exhaustion among younger and middle-aged workers, it’s no surprise that over a third of prime-aged workers in Australia are considering quitting their jobs,” Churchill said.

Automation and the use of AI are expected to impact the ways Australians work in the future, including the arrival of ChatGPT, which can write language with human-like efficiencies. AI advances are poised to reduce human decision-making, but the report found Australian workers are largely unprepared for these challenges. Report co-author Professor David Bissell said the report found that most Australians aren’t too worried about being replaced by AI and automation at work, and believe that their skills are adequate to meet the challenges ahead. “However, our research shows that Australians are cautious adopters of new technologies in the workplace. One in five say they only adopt new technologies in the workplace when they are forced to, so we need to understand the reasons behind this and facilitate technology use that is inclusive to all,” Bissell said.

The pandemic severely impacted caregivers — people providing care for others in their lives — citing school closures, working from home and reduced access to outsourced care as additional stressors to working in a challenging pandemic environment. Working caregivers are more likely to be dissatisfied with their jobs and consider quitting than their non-caregiver counterparts. Four in 10 working caregivers believe their career opportunities are limited.

Report co-author Professor Leah Ruppanner said workplaces must take a more holistic approach to caregiving, including ensuring men also have access to flexible work and employment policies. “Caregivers are working harder than before the pandemic, and they’re at risk of workplace attrition. We often focus on women caregivers, but our report finds that caregiving men are also exhausted, less productive and seeing fewer opportunities for advancement,” Ruppanner said.

Thirty-eight per cent of workers said they had a chronic illness — higher than the 32% found in the Australian Census in 2021 — which researchers said may reflect the emergence of Long COVID and the growing mental distress of working during the pandemic. Over 40% of people with a chronic illness want to quit their jobs, while almost three-quarters of workers with a chronic illness said their illness is made worse by their job. The report found that discrimination at work is more widespread than previously identified; it remains pervasive, particularly against women, people with chronic illnesses and caregivers, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.

Almost two-thirds of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander respondents said they were turned down for a job because they were Indigenous; those with chronic illnesses reported similar rates of being turned down because of their illness. Despite the bleak findings, Australian workers found the flexible ways of working during the pandemic made them happier and more productive, and the majority said ongoing flexible work arrangements are critical to their staying with their current employers.

“There’s this flawed assumption that in-person work was ideal for most prior to the pandemic — but for mothers, caregivers and people living with chronic illnesses, it wasn’t. A return to normal is a return to unequal employment experiences and outcomes for these groups. The pandemic has highlighted the personal and professional benefits of flexible and remote ways of working for many, and it’s clear that most Australian workers don’t want to go back to a ‘traditional’ work environment,” Ruppanner said.

The report has called for the government to improve Australia’s preparedness for the future of work by providing free universal high-quality childcare; legislating workers’ access to flexible and remote work as a workplace right consistent with other OECD nations; and providing equal access to technological upskilling, especially for traditionally underrepresented groups — to respond to the changes facing Australia.

125,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Northern Territory will implement new work health and safety regulations to address workplace psychosocial hazards from 1 July 2023. Under the Work Health and Safety (National Uniform Legislation) Act 2011, businesses have a duty to implement reasonable measures to manage psychosocial risks. These new regulations will clarify this existing duty without imposing new requirements.

A new code of practice is also underway to give practical risk management guidance essential for creating and maintaining mentally healthy workplaces. NT WorkSafe Executive Director Peggy Cheong said managing psychosocial hazards is just as important as managing physical hazards; if left unmanaged, they may cause psychological or even physical harm.

“Psychosocial hazards usually arise from job design or management issues, poor working environments and unhealthy behaviours at work such as bullying and harassment. These hazards are unfortunately becoming prevalent in Australian workplaces, with the number of psychological injuries increasing over the years. The trend is the same for the Territory, so having the new regulations and code of practice is timely and crucial to ensure employers are well equipped to deal with these hazards effectively,” Cheong said.

NT WorkSafe has organised information sessions to educate stakeholders about this growing workplace concern and its negative impacts on one’s health, safety and productivity. Cheong encouraged all Territory businesses to participate in these sessions, which will help them better understand their legal obligations and guide them through the steps to manage psychosocial risks.

The sessions will take place on 17 April, 21 April, 15 May, 18 May, 14 June and 15 June. Further information about the new regulations can be found here.

126,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"RMIT Fashion Design students have designed a series of gender diverse toolbelts for a project involving Vocational Education Trades students, addressing the need for more inclusive trade wear for women and gender diverse people. Only about 3% of tradies are women and there are many barriers to women entering this sector, including flexibility for those with caring responsibilities, women’s toilets in TAFEs and uniforms that fit. In a 2013 report commissioned by the New South Wales Skills Board’s predecessor, the Board of Vocational Education and Training, it was found that while issues like this may seem small, they can be a daily, major irritant to women in trades.

Melissa Tinetti, Director (Built Environment and Sustainability) at RMIT, has personal experience of this. “From my experience as a woman in the construction industry it has always been a challenge to find suitable toolbelts and, at times, even clothing,” Tinetti said.

RMIT fashion student Charlotte Hunter said that as the trade industry becomes more gender diverse, so too must the workwear. “Coming from a female perspective, toolbelts currently available in the market are not designed for my figure. Their anchor points are predominantly around the hips and slide down with any excess weight,” Hunter said.

For non-male bodies, this uneven weight distribution could cause injury if worn for long periods of time. To mitigate the potential for injury and design a toolbelt that works on a wider array of figures, Hunter worked with two major anchor points on the shoulders and waist. “The symmetric design allows for even weight distribution, and by anchoring around the waist of a feminine figure, the belt will not slide down and potentially cause injury,” Hunter said.

Fashion design and plumbing trades students also contributed their ideas to the project. Sebastian La Rocca, Program Manager for Plumbing and Carpentry, said the students captured the essence of a toolbelt and reimagined it in many different ways. “I would love to see some of these concepts become reality,” La Rocca said.

While there are no plans to take these designs to market yet, it has pushed the students to think differently about how everyday tools and clothes can be better designed with diversity in mind. “This has shown me we don’t have to just accept what already exists, we can adapt and change products to make people’s lives easier and more productive. By paying attention to the needs of the wearer, a new and necessary product can be created. With this fresh lens on design, I can bring initiative to my final year of study and hopefully solve problems and fill gaps in any market,” Hunter said.

127,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A survey of over 1000 transport gig workers, conducted by the McKell Institute, Transport Workers Union and TEACHO, has revealed that low pay, job insecurity and the absence of fair, safe and sustainable standards make genuine ‘flexibility’ an illusion. 81% of survey respondents depend on the income to survive, and over three-quarters have to work long hours to make ends meet, yet hourly pay decreases the more hours are worked.

The survey showed low pay and job insecurity are major safety concerns, as more than half of the respondents experience work-related stress, anxiety and mental health issues, while 56% of food delivery riders reported feeling pressure to rush and take risks on the road to earn enough money and avoid deactivation for being deemed too slow. Since 2017, 11 food delivery riders and one rideshare driver have been killed in Australia.

The survey revealed that 54% of respondents rate fair pay and safe conditions as their top priority, while 46% prioritise flexible hours. However, the survey exposed the inflexibility of gig work in its current form, with 41% needing to work more than 40 hours a week and 69% saying that to earn enough they are compelled to work during peak hours. One survey respondent said, “I work 7 days a week and often above 70–80 hours a week and I barely make enough money to live.”

Another worker said their biggest worry is the pressure to drive more hours to make more money. “Since the pay is so low, we have to drive more and more,” the worker said.

Of the 79% of respondents using multiple apps, three-quarters said they need to do so to earn enough income, while a third said it’s for job security, to protect them against their accounts being suddenly deactivated by the algorithm. More than a quarter of the respondents reported having their accounts deactivated and half listed deactivation as one of their top three concerns, while 65% said the work doesn’t give them the job security they need.

The survey received overwhelming support for reform, with 95% of workers calling for regulation to set standards for transport gig work. TWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said that although many food delivery, parcel delivery and rideshare drivers are drawn to this work on the promise of flexible hours, this is unobtainable without the existence of fair, safe and sustainable standards.

“These findings reveal that the future of gig work is unsustainable for all involved unless enforceable standards for fair pay, decent conditions and job security are put in place. Global gig companies Uber, Menulog and DoorDash have recognised this and joined workers in pushing for reform. Now it’s up to federal parliament to pass legislation so that the Fair Work Commission can get on with creating a safety net for transport gig work so it can become truly flexible as well as fair,” Kaine said.

McKell Institute CEO Michael Buckland said the survey shows that tens of thousands of people in Australia are effectively experiencing wage theft and have no rights to sick leave, superannuation or workers compensation. According to Buckland, the survey found that a third of transport gig workers had been injured at work and three in five had to fend for themselves with no income while sick or injured. “In the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, tens of thousands of workers are earning less than minimum wage and feeling the pressure to rush and work long hours to make ends meet. This is a risk to their safety and others. These results make it clear that federal parliament must act immediately to reform the rules around gig work,” Buckland said.

Paul Ryan, Chair of TEACHO, said that the survey is a crucial piece of research that must inform the federal parliament when considering further IR legislation. “Gig models have permeated the transport industry and this survey shows a bleak and dangerous future for transport work if reform is not passed urgently. We’ve seen gig models infiltrate trucking overseas and we’re seeing it spread deeper into transport sectors in Australia through Amazon and FedEx. This report shows what can happen when regulation is absent in an industry like transport, which literally carries this country. Failure to regulate causes death and injury,” Ryan said.

128,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has published a snapshot exploring the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on workers returning to work after an injury or illness. The snapshot provides valuable insights for workers’ compensation authorities and other key stakeholders about what it was like for workers making a return to work during the pandemic. It is based on findings from the ‘2021 National Return to Work Survey’ summary report, which was used to guide the delivery of the National Return to Work Strategy 2020–2030.

The snapshot found that one in five injured or ill workers said the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on their return to work and recovery. Workers suffering from a psychological injury and those experiencing distress were more likely to report that the pandemic had impacted their recovery and return to work. Injured workers under the age of 25 were the most likely to respond that they had been stood down or had their hours reduced during the pandemic. More than 20% of workers surveyed responded that the pandemic had positively influenced their recovery and return to work.

The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic was most felt in injured workers aged 35–44 and 45–54, with 24.5% and 25.2% reporting that the pandemic had affected their return to work. Those aged 18–24 (36%) most frequently reported having their hours reduced or being stood down from their work following a work-related injury. This was in line with the ABS Labour Force Survey which found that people in younger age groups experienced larger decreases in employment and larger increases in unemployment during the pandemic.

The jurisdictions with the largest proportion of injured or ill workers significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic were Victoria (26.4%), NSW (21.6%), ACT (20.6%), Tasmania (19.1%) and Queensland (18.5%). The Northern Territory had fewer workers reporting that they were substantially affected (11.2%), followed by WA and South Australia with 17.1% and 17.5% respectively.

129,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Research conducted by the University of East Anglia (UEA) has revealed some of the challenges that transgender and non-binary staff can face at work. The study, published in the journal Work, Employment & Society, shows how their experiences can help illuminate the ways in which the working context might be changed to create a more inclusive environment that is receptive to more diverse gender identities. For example, through the provision of non-gendered changing and bathroom spaces, and processes that enable people to complete forms and choose pronouns in line with their identity.

While there are various examples of good practice and initiatives to make workplaces more inclusive, there is little research that shows the story of employees being transgender or non-binary at work. Transgender workers are often subject to discrimination, harassment and violence, despite gender identity being a protected characteristic in many contexts.

The study looks at how individual experiences combine with organisational culture, processes and working relationships to produce moments where diverse gender identities can be accepted or denied, which can be very damaging for transgender workers. Lead author Dr David Watson, associate professor in organisational behaviour at UEA’s Norwich Business School, said the research findings are important because transgender and non-binary people do not have a strong voice in all workplaces, and where they are not inclusive or welcoming this can lead to significant harms.

The research team, from UEA and the University of Valle d’Aosta in Italy, met with 11 Italian transgender workers to hear their stories, which were then analysed to understand how their experiences challenged binary gender norms and how they could inform the transformation of workplaces so they become more inclusive, such as providing awareness training for staff that embeds an understanding of gender identity as fluid and constructed.

Co-author Angelo Benozzo from the University of Valle d’Aosta said the transgender workers’ stories conveyed some of the stigma and harms that transgender workers can experience; however, they also addressed some positive experiences. “Departing from expected gender norms exposes individuals to vulnerabilities, although it may also prompt reflection on the nature of gender, thereby encouraging acceptance in the workplace and reducing vulnerability for others,” Benozzo said.

The study is based on an understanding of gender that sees gender identity as something that is performative and potentially fluid rather than fixed or given. Cultural expectations of what constitute ‘acceptable’ gender identities shape how people ‘do’ gender, for example, through the way they dress. When the heterosexual model of gender is considered the default gender identity, this concept of heteronormativity reinforces gender binarism — the idea that society only has two genders, male and female — that heterosexuality is expected, and other gender identities are regarded as less intelligible or even acceptable.

“The desirability of subverting gender norms depends on what those gender norms are, how they constrain or harm individuals and the potential consequences for those who challenge them. Therefore, our research does not point to the need for transgender workers themselves to subvert gender norms, but rather we need to challenge binary gender norms in the workplace to enable all individuals to freely express their gender identity,” Watson said.

130,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has reported 15- to 25-year-olds have a 75% greater chance of being injured at work with apprentice deaths and serious injuries peaking between 7 am and 10 am.

With approximately 15% of the Australian workforce made up of workers between 15–24 years* and over 14,000 serious workers’ compensation claims made by workers in this age group. One of the contributing factors to workplace injuries is young and inexperienced workers being unable to recognise and cope with potential hazards.

As an employer, you must ensure the work environment and the way workers carry out their work is safe, regardless of the type and terms of their employment. This includes protecting young workers from both physical and psychological workplace hazards. Employers of young workers should ensure the apprentice is supervised at all times and working safely with the correct use of PPE and making sure the apprentice participates in Toolbox Talks and signs off on Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS).

131,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A collaborative study carried out by researchers in the US, Australia and Europe has found that managers contacting remote working employees out of hours causes extra job stress, and has called for policies and laws to protect employees from these increasingly common “out-of-hours intrusions”. The study surveyed 896 Americans in a range of blue-collar and white-collar jobs including administration communications, finance and insurance roles in the healthcare sector, and construction workers, plumbers and electricians.

Respondents reported higher stress levels and depressive moods associated with managers contacting them or requesting responses after work hours. One of the researchers from RMIT University in Australia, Professor Mayowa Babalola, said that while COVID disruptions sold many on the illusion of freedom in working from home and flexible work hours, the study revealed the opposite.

“Borderless workplaces are giving managers 24/7 access to employees where constant connectivity with managers is an expectation rather than an option. We found many are realising that the constant ping of Teams and late-night emails are bringing work stress and depressive symptoms into their personal lives,” Babalola said.

Babalola said unnecessary and non-urgent intrusions by managers need to be managed in order to avoid employee burnout. “With more people working from home and more flexible hours, employers and employees need to introduce mechanisms and boundaries to cope with the intrusion of work into their home domains.”

Babalola said managers can avoid imposing this stress on their teams by taking the perspective of those they are sending messages to. “This approach can be as simple as scheduling messages for the next day or making it very clear the receiver of the message is not expected to read or respond outside of their agreed work hours.”

The research team also called for corporate policies and laws to protect workers from out-of-hours contact and deter managers from contacting their employees at certain times. Babalola said that while working from home and flexible work hours can have many benefits, a line needs to be drawn to enable workers to completely switch off from the stresses of work and recharge.

“Calling for these boundaries is easier said than done, so there [need to be] formal rules in place to ensure managers are respecting their employees’ personal time,” Babalola said.

The research findings were published in the Work & Stress Journal.

132,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Transport Workers Union has called for urgent industry reform as the death toll from truck crashes on Australian roads reached 51 for the year so far, with 12 of those truck drivers. The toll reached 50 following the death of a three-month-old girl, whose mother and older sibling were also killed in a collision between a car and a cement truck in Sydney’s south-west.

Trucking is among Australia’s riskiest industries, with pressures of underpayment, fatigue, speeding and overloaded trucks linked to the low-cost contracts demanded by wealthy retailers, manufacturers and oil companies at the top of the supply chain. This distressing figure comes as Australia’s largest cold chain operator, Scott’s Refrigerated, ceases operations amid growing pressure from “uncommercial customer arrangements”. The company is the latest casualty of the supply chain crisis, driven by wealthy retailers and other clients, with thin margins fuelling deadly pressure for drivers and operators to delay maintenance, speed, and drive fatigued to make ends meet.

The TWU recently served a claim on 40 top retailers, food and beverage manufacturers and agricultural companies demanding they sign up to six principles to make their supply chains safer, fairer and more sustainable. TWU National Secretary Michael Kaine said urgent intervention from federal parliament is the only way to stop the “death spiral”.

“It’s only the middle of March and we’ve already seen 50 families torn apart by devastating crashes this year. Cannibalistic competition driven by wealthy clients is only going to pile on the pressure for drivers and operators to drive fatigued, skip vital maintenance and speed. The deaths aren’t going to stop until those wealthy clients take responsibility for safety, fairness and sustainability all the way through their supply chains,” Kaine said.

Kaine urged the federal parliament to back reform that will set minimum standards in the trucking industry, adding that reform can start right away with clients stepping up and committing to improving standards in their supply chains. The Transport Workers Union revealed that since the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, which was dedicated to investigating safety and regulating payment arrangements to reduce financial pressures on truck drivers, ended in 2016, 286 truck drivers have been killed on the job.

133,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A joint Monash University and Ambulance Victoria study aims to better support new paramedics to get a better night’s sleep and improve their mental health. The study, led by Monash University’s Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, with Monash University’s Department of Paramedicine, was published in the journal Sleep.

The study investigated whether poor sleep pre-exposure to paramedic work increases the risk of future mental health outcomes. During the first six months of emergency work, the research team found insomnia and depression symptoms increased in paramedic recruits. Those recruits who already experienced higher insomnia symptoms before starting their careers as paramedics were more likely to have higher depression symptoms after six months.

The findings will pave the way for more support for new paramedics. Senior author Dr Alexander Wolkow said sleep was a positively modifiable factor; the findings suggested early interventions targeting poor sleep prior to emergency work should be investigated as one potential way to improve sleep and reduce the risk of mental health problems in the future.

Wolkow said the transition into full-time shift work and emergency work is a challenging period for new recruits. “The demanding nature of emergency work routinely exposes personnel to potentially traumatic events, placing these workers at high risk of mental health issues. Early interventions that target poor sleep in paramedic students and new recruits may potentially offer some protection against them developing mental health problems, particularly in those first few months at work, but further research is urgently needed in this area,” Wolkow said.

Lead author Ell Nguyen said past research had found the prevalence of insomnia, along with other sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and PTSD, were higher among Australian paramedics when compared to the general population. “These issues may contribute to high turnover among emergency service personnel and may be preventable,” Nguyen said.

Compared to other emergency services such as firefighters and police, prior research reveals that paramedics have increased rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and experience high levels of depression and anxiety. Ambulance Victoria paramedic and co-author Dr Ben Meadley said Ambulance Victoria recognised the challenging nature of shift work, especially during the first few years of a paramedic’s career.

“We support our new recruits with additional supervision and training in their first two years. With the help of a clinical instructor, graduate paramedics undertake further clinical study and on-road training to transition from classroom to the community. We continue to provide support for our people and their immediate family members, with peer support, pastoral care and counselling services available 24 hours a day,” Meadley said.

The current study examined 101 participants between August 2018 and December 2020. Participants were recruited into the study and completed an assessment before starting work as a paramedic. The same participants were assessed again after approximately six months of work as a paramedic; at each assessment, participants completed an online sleep and mental health survey. They also wore a wearable device that measured sleep and completed a self-reported sleep diary. Nguyen said the research findings will help provide a better understanding of the challenges paramedics face, and the steps that can be taken to enhance support services to ensure paramedics are healthy and have long and fulfilling careers.

“This research highlights the need for evidence-based solutions to be rapidly developed and deployed to support workplace mental health.

134,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Weld Australia has called on the federal government to implement a proactive, targeted approach that engages and recruits women into the trades, implements innovative trade training programs designed specifically for women and sets measurable gender diversity targets on government-funded projects.

“Australia will have a shortfall of at least 70,000 welders by 2030. Industry is already at capacity. Weld Australia’s members are currently operating at 50% to 70% capacity, and turning away work because they cannot find enough welders,” said Geoff Crittenden, Weld Australia CEO.

According to Crittenden, increasing diversity in the trades is one of the best ways to alleviate the looming skills shortage, with every effort to be made to encourage women to become welders.

“There are significant economic benefits for women in welding, from increased choice and availability of jobs, through to improved job security, higher than average pay and ample opportunities for progression and promotion. A career in welding is safe and secure — once you’re qualified, you can walk into a job tomorrow. Welding is in demand because it is essential to the success of so many industries,” Crittenden said.

The five-year pipeline of major federally funded infrastructure projects is valued at $237 billion. On top of this, skilled welders will be needed to build and install wind and transmission towers, solar farms and other power generation assets that are needed to achieve the federal government’s 43% emissions reductions target by 2030 and net zero by 2050. With all these government-funded projects in play, measurable gender diversity targets on government-funded projects would have a huge impact.

In effect since January 2022, the Victorian Government’s Building Equality Policy (BEP) aims to disrupt gender stereotypes in the country’s most male-dominated industry. The BEP applies to new government projects, and it mandates female representation in at least 3% of each trade role, 7% of each non-trade position and 35% management, supervisor and specialist labour roles. It also mandates that 4% of labour hours for apprentices and trainees are performed by women.

“If the federal government mandated a policy similar to Victoria’s Building Equality Policy, then the necessary recruitment and training programs would follow,” Crittenden said.

Weld Australia is also working on grassroots programs to encourage young women to pursue a career in welding. One of these is the Advanced Manufacturing Outreach Program in New South Wales. The program relies on the use of augmented reality welding simulators to give kids a real welding experience. The simulators are used to teach students in Year 9 to develop an understanding of welding across all common processes in a safe and controlled environment. The technology is also being utilised by students in years 10–12 to support the delivery of Manufacturing and Engineering and Industrial Technology (Metal) as part of MEM20413 Certificate II in Engineering Pathways.

“The Advanced Manufacturing Outreach Program is unique because it actually engages kids. It is hands-on, fun and educational. The program uses Seaberry’s Soldamatic augmented reality welding simulators to gamify the learning experience. Anyone can try their hand at the welding simulators and be a star. The gamification of learning is particularly effective when trying to encourage females, Indigenous Australians, people living with disabilities and those from a disadvantaged background into a career in STEM. Training in schools must be refocused to showcase the opportunities in trades and encourage women and other underrepresented groups into careers in STEM,” Crittenden said.

Crittenden added that gender equality and diversity in the construction and manufacturing industry workforce is a persistent problem that exacerbates skills shortages, reduces economic productivity and constrains innovation.

“Encouraging the participation of women in male-oriented industries such as welding, construction and manufacturing is long overdue in ending the cycle of employment disparity, gender pay gap and representation of women in management positions. Industry research demonstrates that investing in well-paid, secure jobs, expanding the Commonwealth Paid Parental Leave scheme, making early childhood education more affordable and accessible, and making workplaces safe from sexual harassment were key to getting women into work. All these measures must be implemented by both our governments and private industry,” Crittenden said.

135,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A global survey of business travellers has revealed that seven in 10 (71%) of female business travellers say travelling for work as a woman is less safe than travelling as a man. The Opinium survey of 2000 business travellers in Australia, Canada, United States and United Kingdom, commissioned by World Travel protection, a global travel risk management organisation, revealed that women travellers are more likely to take measures to protect their safety during business travel than men. Additionally, 31% said they do not travel or go out on their own at night, compared to 18% of men, while 46% said they always stay in close touch with family and friends so their whereabouts are known, compared to 36% of men.

Almost one in five (19%) women business travellers also felt their organisation should act with women’s safety in mind when they are travelling alone, by ensuring that flights do not arrive late at night. Global women’s equality issues are also of greater concern to women than men, with 36% saying they do not like travelling to countries where women’s rights are not protected, compared to 15% of men. In their hotel or accommodation, both men and women took extra steps to protect their security, for example by placing a chair against the hotel door to deter a potential intruder (16% for both men and women), and using room service so they don’t have to eat in a restaurant on their own (17% for both men and women). Moreover, 21% of women business travellers preferred to stay in hotels that make provisions for solo women travellers, and 19% wore a wedding ring (real or fake) to avoid unwanted attention.

The survey also found that 12% of women business travellers have experienced a negative incident, ranging from minor theft to assault when travelling, and 10% have been unwell with a women’s health problem while travelling but felt unable to get help because of the stigma around women’s health issues. Kate Fitzpatrick, Regional Security Director for World Travel Protection, said that compared to men, women often have different safety considerations to think about when travelling for work, with the risk generally increasing in countries with less equality.

“It’s essential, therefore, that women have a full understanding of the cultural norms in their destinations from what to wear to how they act, for example perhaps avoiding alcohol in public. We often undertake specific risk assessments for women business travellers to make sure their safety and security is the highest priority,” Fitzpatrick said.

According to Fitzpatrick, as well as safety considerations, women business travellers may face gender bias in some cultures where it’s not the norm to have women in senior roles. “I’ve personally experienced sexism and push-back because of my gender. People are surprised to meet a woman Director of Security, and whether it is a police chief in South America or a site risk inspection in West Africa, I regularly have to detail my past work in security and government law enforcement to give me credibility, something which my men colleagues never have to do,” Fitzpatrick said.","A global survey of business travellers has revealed that seven in 10 (71%) of female business travellers say travelling for work as a woman is less safe than travelling as a man.

136,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A national coalition of over 40 legal service providers, unions, ethnic community peak bodies, churches and national organisations has called on the Minister for Home Affairs Clare O’Neil to urgently spotlight widespread migrant worker exploitation. Led by the Migrant Justice Institute and Human Rights Law Centre, the ‘Breaking the Silence’ proposal urges the federal government to establish whistle-blower protections that would enable migrant workers to report exploitation without risking their visa.

The federal government’s review of Australia’s migration system will report in April, as the government is devising strategies for faster and greater migrant intake. With hundreds of thousands of international students, skilled workers and backpackers arriving or returning to the country, there is an opportunity and need to implement these reforms within the next six months. From 1 July 2023, the government will reinstate limits on international student work hours, putting thousands of underpaid students at risk of visa cancellation if they speak up for working extra hours in order to earn the equivalent of minimum wage.

The Migrant Justice Institute has surveyed over 15,000 migrant workers over the past five years; these studies have consistently found that around three-quarters of migrant workers earned below the casual minimum wage in Australia, and a quarter earned less than half that. Nine out of 10 underpaid workers suffered in silence and took no action. Migrant workers generally endure exploitation in silence for fear of jeopardising their visa or ability to stay in Australia.

The proposed reforms in the ‘Breaking the Silence’ report include a protection against visa cancellation for exploited migrant workers who take action against their employer and have breached their work conditions, and a short-term visa to allow exploited migrant workers to remain in Australia and pursue a claim against their employer, with visa security and the ability to work. Associate Professor Laurie Berg, UTS, Co-Executive Director of the Migrant Justice Institute, noted that harsh penalties for unscrupulous employers are useless if migrant workers are too fearful to report them. “Without the whistle-blower protections we’re proposing, employers know they won’t get caught underpaying migrant workers and exploitation will remain business as usual,” Berg said.

Associate Professor Bassina Farbenblum, Co-Executive Director of the Migrant Justice Institute, said it is immoral for the government to draw migrants and international students back to Australia knowing full well that it has not fixed the problems that will lead to many of them being exploited and unable to speak up. “Enabling exploited migrant workers to speak up is sensible government policy. After a decade of government inaction, these reforms will finally make a dent on migrant exploitation without creating red tape for businesses doing the right thing,” Farbenblum said.

Sanmati Verma, Managing Lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the conditions for exploitation are built into Australia’s visa system. “If migrant workers can’t speak up without fear of losing their place in Australia, most will never come forward. When they leave Australia, new migrant workers will simply replace them in those exploitative jobs. These whistle-blower protections must be a cornerstone of the government’s migration reforms.”

The Australian Red Cross has recently launched a website to prevent and address migrant worker exploitation in Australia. The website was designed with input from over 150 migrant workers and 250 service providers, union, community organisations and academia. The Work Right Hub includes information, tools and services aimed at supporting migrants if they, or someone they know, is experiencing labour exploitation. Australian Red Cross Director of Australian Programs Vicki Mau said the website will make a real difference, especially for migrant workers who are unable to reach out for help.

“Working closely with migrants has clearly shown us that a number of factors prevent people from reporting exploitation. These include lack of awareness of their rights in Australia, language barriers, experiences of isolation or working in remote locations, and fear of authorities. For example, 52% did not know where to complain if experiencing labour exploitation,” Mau said.

The Work Right Hub is available here.","Migrant workers generally endure exploitation in silence for fear of jeopardising their visa or ability to stay in Australia.

137,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Fair Work Act has been amended to prohibit (or ban) sexual harassment in connection with work, including in the workplace. These changes came into effect on 6 March 2023 and expanded the previous protections around sexual harassment in the workplace. The new provisions expand protections from sexual harassment to protect workers, future workers, and people conducting a business or undertaking. These changes are part of the Australian Government’s Secure Jobs, Better Pay legislation.

The protection applies to workers including employees, contractors, work experience students, volunteers, future workers, and people conducting a business or undertaking. The protection won’t apply to sexual harassment that started before 6 March 2023.

A person or company can be liable for sexual harassment conducted by an employee or agent in connection with work, including if they were involved in the employer’s contravention. This applies unless the person or company can prove that they took all reasonable steps to prevent the sexual harassment. The Fair Work Commission has provided further information about understanding sexual harassment in the workplace; managing sexual harassment in the workplace; and taking action in the Fair Work Commission and via other government bodies.

The Commission now has greater powers to deal with workplace sexual harassment; in addition to its existing ‘stop sexual harassment order’ powers, the Commission can deal with disputes about sexual harassment by conciliation, mediation, or making a recommendation or expressing an opinion. When a dispute can’t be resolved in these ways, the Commission may also deal with the dispute by arbitration if the parties agree. If this happens, the Commission can make an order for compensation or lost wages, or requiring a person to do something that’s reasonable to remedy any loss or damage suffered.

Applications to the Commission can be made by a person or group of people alleging sexual harassment (such as a worker or a group of workers), or an industrial association (such as a union), on behalf of their member or members. Applications may also be able to be made in court in some circumstances. Further information about reporting sexual harassment can be found on the Fair Work Commission — Issues we can help with website.

The Fair Work Commission is the national workplace regulator. It can help with some issues around sexual harassment at work, usually once an employee has already sought help, such as from the Commission. This includes investigating a workplace for non-compliance with laws prohibiting workplace sexual harassment, and taking action when someone doesn’t comply with a Commission ‘stop sexual harassment’ order. The Commission also has the power to start court proceedings for alleged breaches of laws prohibiting sexual harassment.

139,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia (SWA) has opened public consultation on the prohibition of the use of engineered stone. This follows a national agreement to adopt SWA recommendations aimed at reducing workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica. The consultation paper presents three options for the prohibition, including evidence and data to inform the impact analysis of these options. Safe Work Australia’s Decision Regulation Impact Statement: Managing the risks of respirable crystalline silica at work (Decision RIS) analysed the impacts of regulatory and non-regulatory options to manage the risks of respirable crystalline silica at work.

On 28 February 2023, WHS Ministers considered the Decision RIS and agreed to the following options, as recommended by SWA. Option 2 relates to national awareness and behaviour change initiatives, Option 5a addresses the regulation of high-risk crystalline silica processes for all materials (including engineered stone) across all industries, while Option 6 calls for further analysis and consultation on the prohibition on use of engineered stone. Option 6 includes consideration of silica content levels and other risk factors, and a national licensing system for products that are not subject to a ban, or legacy products.

The Decision RIS follows work undertaken by SWA since 2018 to reduce exposure to respirable crystalline silica and prevent silicosis and silica-related diseases, including reducing the workplace exposure standard for respirable crystalline silica, publishing the ‘Working with silica and silica containing products guide’ (and translating this into six other languages), and publishing the model Code of Practice: Managing the risks of respirable crystalline silica from engineered stone in the workplace.

Safe Work Australia also amended the model WHS Regulations to clarify that uncontrolled processing of engineered stone is prohibited, and launched the ‘Clean Air. Clear Lungs.’ campaign to raise awareness of occupational lung diseases aimed at high-risk industries such as construction, agriculture, manufacturing and those working with engineered stone. Between 2010–11 and 2020–21 there were 488 accepted workers compensation claims for silicosis in the jurisdictions covered by the model WHS laws.

WHS Ministers from around Australia, including South Australia’s Industrial Relations Minister Kyam Maher MLC, met with Federal Employment and Workplace Relations Minister the Hon Tony Burke MP to discuss the key issues including action to reduce workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica. Since then, Safe Work Australia has released a public consultation paper through its Engage website, with submissions to be open until 2 April 2023.

Stakeholder feedback from the consultation will inform a Safe Work Australia report to be provided to WHS Ministers for their consideration. Businesses, workers and interested parties are also encouraged to express their views on the said paper to assist WHS Ministers in considering steps to further mitigate the risks of working with silica-dust-containing materials such as engineered stone.

Safe Work Australia CEO Michelle Baxter welcomed the decision by WHS Ministers to agree to recommendations on action to reduce workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica and prevent silicosis and silica-related diseases in Australia.

“I encourage all stakeholders to go to Safe Work Australia’s consultation website Engage to take part and have your say on a prohibition on the use of engineered stone. We will also work closely with WHS regulators and other stakeholders, including industry and unions, to implement the options agreed by WHS Ministers, including further national awareness and behaviour-change initiatives and regulation of high-risk crystalline silica processes for all materials, including engineered stone, and across all industries,” Baxter said.

Silica is a naturally occurring and abundant mineral that forms the major component of most rocks and soils. The most common type of crystalline silica is quartz. Its abundance varies from 2% in marble and limestone to 20–45% (typically 30%) in granite and 70–95% in natural sandstone. Engineered stone can contain up to 97% silica.

Crystalline silica is most dangerous to health when dust is generated, becomes airborne and is then inhaled by a worker. The dust is generated in workplace mechanical processes such as crushing, cutting, drilling, grinding, sawing or polishing of natural stone or man-made products that contain silica. Fabrication and installation of composite stone countertops, construction labouring activities, mining and paving can generate respirable silica dust particles. If a worker is exposed to and breathes in silica dust they could develop a range of diseases including acute silicosis, lung cancer, emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

141,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Safe Work Australia has released a 10-year national strategy to reduce workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses. The Australian Work Health and Safety Strategy 2023–2033 sets a national vision of safe and healthy work for all and provides a platform for delivering key work health and safety (WHS) improvement. The strategy was developed under Safe Work Australia’s tripartite governance processes and has been agreed by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It represents a national commitment to work together to reduce further fatalities, injuries and illnesses over the next decade.

The strategy outlines targets to measure progress over the next decade, including a reduction in worker fatalities caused by traumatic injuries of 30%. More than 150 stakeholders were consulted on the development of the strategy. Safe Work Australia Chair Joanne Farrell said the strategy sets a national framework for improving work health and safety over the next 10 years.

“Achieving the vision of the strategy — Safe and healthy work for all — is not possible without the important contributions of key stakeholders. Jurisdictions, industry groups, WHS researchers, experts, practitioners and workers all have a role to play in realising progress under the strategy. I invite everyone in the work health and safety system to play a part in realising the ambitious outcomes set by the strategy,” Farrell said.

Safe Work Australia Chief Executive Officer Michelle Baxter said the strategy addresses ongoing and emerging challenges in work health and safety over the next decade, including managing psychosocial risks, the rise of artificial intelligence, automation and related technologies, and new types of work including gig work. Baxter added that Safe Work Australia will drive action and monitor the progress of the strategy targets.

“Everyone who goes to work has the right to return home safely. While data shows that fatal and serious injuries at work have declined over the last decade, Australian workers are still getting sick and injured, sometimes fatally, from work. Through this strategy we are focusing our efforts to ensure the work health and safety system in Australia can improve outcomes and address emerging challenges over the next decade,” Baxter said.

According to Safe Work Australia, 169 workers were fatally injured at work in 2021. Over 130,000 workers compensation claims were accepted for serious work-related injury or illness. Vehicle incidents, being hit by moving objects and falls from a height accounted for the most fatalities, while body-stressing, falls, slips and trips, and being hit by moving objects were the cause of most workplace injuries. Mental health conditions accounted for a small but increasing proportion of serious claims, rising from 6% of all serious claims in 2014–15 to 9% in 2020–21.

Data from Safe Work Australia also shows that 70% of fatalities and 61% of serious workers compensation claims occur in six industries: agriculture, construction, transport, manufacturing, health care and social assistance, and public administration and safety. The most common causes of workplace injury are vehicle incidents, body stressing, falls, slips and trips, and being hit by moving objects. The most common causes of workplace psychological injuries include work pressure, harassment and bullying, occupational violence and other mental stress factors. The most common work-related illnesses are respiratory diseases, zoonotic diseases, mental health and cancer.

142,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Queensland Parliament’s Inquiry into Coal Mining Industry Safety report has found that it is common practice for mine workers to be punished for raising safety concerns. The report backs up what is commonly known in the state’s coal mining industry; namely that workers face reprisal if they raise safety concerns.

Steve Smyth, Queensland District President of the Mining and Energy Union, said there are a number of key recommendations that need to be backed by changes to the law. Smyth said that the report calls out “clear tension” between high coal production targets and safety, while reinforcing the important role of unions in upholding safety.

“In the last five years we have seen six deaths on the Queensland coalfields where no-one has been held responsible, no fines on companies, no disciplinary action for managers, we need these recommendations implemented immediately. The report recommends beefing up activity by the regulator, which is a no-brainer and should start immediately,” Smyth said.

Smyth added that the report accepts that repercussions for workers who raise safety concerns are rife in the industry. The report also recommends passing new laws to stop this.

“We know coal workers fear being disciplined and sacked if they raise safety concerns, especially labour hire workers. These measures need to be implemented urgently. Only in the last few weeks we have seen a spate of dozer accidents leading to serious injuries — we have no time to waste,” Smyth said.","The Queensland Parliament’s Inquiry into Coal Mining Industry Safety report has found that it is common practice for mine workers to be punished for raising safety concerns.

143,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A former Charles Darwin University (CDU) student has developed an augmented reality app to support construction safety training in remote NT communities and assist First Nations workers to learn and work on country while improving local housing. Issues such as overcrowding, poor housing conditions and a severe housing shortage impact remote communities, and there is a need to train local tradespeople to support community construction and maintenance projects.

CDU Master of Information Technology (Software Engineering) alumnus Anand Kujur developed a game-based learning application that allows users to refresh their knowledge of safety risks and measures in the construction site. The application, called Safety First NT, focuses on providing an interactive aid to facilitate more effective and efficient learning at the work site.

“When local First Nations tradesmen aren’t involved in construction projects or are away from the community, their prior training may not be so easily recalled when they come back. We’re addressing this issue with a visual communication tool on a convenient, handheld device that can be passed around the workers to help refresh their training,” Kujur said.

The number of First Nations people working in construction in the Northern Territory has reportedly increased in recent years. Local community members also provide work on construction sites and perform general upkeep and maintenance of housing, when tradespeople from urban areas return to base. Kujur said the app provides a visual display of how to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) on a construction site, complete with danger signage and the risk of falling debris. The mode of teaching can also be adopted to other material.

“Future versions can also include simulated guides of everyday home maintenance tasks, such as how to change a tap or tighten hinges on a door frame, to help community members repair their homes while tradesmen aren’t there,” Kujur said.

Project supervisor and CDU Information Technology lecturer Dr Cat Kutay said the application can also have an audio guide in different First Nations languages. Kutay said refreshing safety training regularly can enable skilled workers to learn remotely on country without having to leave and attend training hundreds of kilometres from home. This creates a stabilised workforce and brings in income to be shared with family and the community.

“The oral sharing of knowledge is such a strong and integral part of First Nations culture, so applying this familiar way of communication to our safety training app will allow construction workers to familiarise themselves quickly. Anand’s project is one of many we are working on at CDU in collaboration with First Nations communities and organisations to address digital needs with effective and sustainable solutions,” Kutay said.

CDU is also working on a more audiovisual approach to teaching practical units in communities, with Kujur’s app to provide a template to support this work.

144,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Australian Workers’ Union has called for immediate reform to save workers engaged in tunnelling from deadly silicosis. Thousands of workers are regularly exposed to deadly silica dust during tunnelling, and construction companies make it difficult for unions to bring dust monitors on site and check if workers are being exposed at any given time.

AWU National Secretary Daniel Walton said union officials need clear rights to conduct measuring of airborne contaminants underground. Walton said that companies should also have to automatically supply all dust monitoring results to the regulator and union promptly, instead of the current drawn-out process.

“Right now, in most states, if our officials try to get onsite with a dust monitor device they are blocked by the likes of John Holland. Yet we know silica exposure is all but certain to be occurring at dangerous levels. Our members are working in environments so dusty they can’t see more than 50 metres in front of them. They’re getting covered from head to toe in dust and they walk out with that dust on them which continues to spread,” Walton said.

Walton added that it is also common for companies to operate for days despite ventilation breaking down, with water suppression non-existent in some sites. Flimsy or damaged face masks are also being offered as PPE. “We need union officials to be able to walk into a tunnelling site at any time to test if dust levels are unsafe.”

Walton said other reforms are also necessary to save lives.

“Right now companies know they can pretty much get around the exposure rules with ease and there is no real penalty if they get it wrong. John Holland and others should fear exposing their workers or contractors to dangerous levels of silica dust. So we need much harsher penalties for companies that exceed the silica workplace exposure standard,” Walton said.","The Australian Workers’ Union has called for immediate reform to save workers engaged in tunnelling from deadly silicosis.

145,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The University of South Australia and Australian software business Teamgage have launched a workplace bullying prevention program — Healthy Workplaces by Design — that identifies and mitigates the root causes of bullying. The program extends beyond more obvious interpersonal triggers into psychosocial hazards, such as workplace environments, workload demands and working practices. As a risk audit and prevention program it will help businesses meet new work health and safety (WHS) obligations to proactively risk manage psychosocial hazards, especially workplace bullying.

Approximately 1.1 million Australian workers experience serious workplace bullying, with 39% of mental disorder claims caused by workplace bullying, harassment or violence. Psychological health and safety are foremost on the agenda of Australian WHS policymakers, statutory agencies and peak bodies, particularly since Safe Work Australia published the Model Code of Practice: Managing psychosocial hazards at work. UniSA researcher Professor Michelle Tuckey said the UniSA-Teamgage partnership will deliver a risk management process that uses work redesign to prevent workplace bullying and other psychosocial hazards.

“Every employer has a legal responsibility to provide a safe workplace, but there’s an increasing pressure for businesses to better manage psychosocial risks, including workplace bullying and sexual harassment,” Tuckey said.

According to Tuckey, workplace bullying causes up to $36 billion of lost productivity in each year. Safe Work Australia also recorded a 75% increase in the frequency of bullying claims over the past 10 years. Tuckey believes that the UniSA-Teamgage partnership will enable businesses to undertake a tailored risk audit of their workplace and generate specific recommendations, actions and evaluations to remedy any concerns.

“The amended legislation will require businesses to proactively address workplace bullying (and other psychosocial risks) with the same rigour as physical health and safety hazards, which means they’ll need to go above and beyond administrative controls like policies and training. It shifts the emphasis from responding to interpersonal bullying behaviour to proactively identifying and mitigating the root causes of bullying embedded within work environments,” Tuckey said.

Trialled across 85 sites, Healthy Workplace by Design has led to a 34% reduction in exposure to workplace bullying; a 46% reduction in workplace bullying complaints; and a 73% reduction in sexual harassment complaints. Teamgage CEO and Co-Founder Noelle Smit said the partnership will ensure people have safer, healthier workplaces, in Australia and around the world.

“Teamgage is committed to helping organisations deliver strategic outcomes by creating highly effective teams. We achieve this by empowering teams to continuously improve how they work together, and a part of this is by ensuring a safe and healthy workplace. For this to happen, we need organisations to be constantly alive to the risk of workplace harassment, toxic cultures and mistrust between staff and management — all of which can affect performance, customer outcomes, profit and most importantly, people's wellbeing,” Smit said.","The University of South Australia and Australian software business Teamgage have launched a workplace bullying prevention program — Healthy Workplaces by Design — that identifies and mitigates the root causes of bullying.

146,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"In the Royal Life Saving National Drowning Report 2022 there were 339 drowning deaths in the past 12 months across Australia’s coastline, inland waterways and pools, which is a 15% increase on last year (294) and a 24% increase on the 10-year average with rivers and creeks the leading location for drowning in 2021/22 together with interruptions to regular swimming and learn to swim programs during the COVID-19 pandemic considered key factors. Drowning is one of the leading causes of unintentional death for Australian children:

17 drowning deaths among children aged 0-4 years in the past 12 months.

76% occurred by falling into water with swimming pools accounting for the high percentage in drownings.

Participation in formal swimming lessons was associated with an 88% reduction in the risk of drowning in 1- to 4-year-old children.*

15 drowning deaths among children 5–14 years: a 7% increase on the previous year and a 36% increase on the 10-year average — a reflection of children missing out on swimming lessons. Swimming pools accounted for over half of all drowning deaths of children 5–14 years.

Royal Life Saving Society - Australia analysis of November 2021 enrolments of children in formal swimming lessons decreased by 25% compared to the previous year, with the greatest impact among children aged between 7 and 12 years with 75% of children not participating in formal swimming lessons from 8 years old with 40% of children leaving primary school without being able to achieve key swimming and water safety benchmarks. Alarmingly, less than 50% of children aged between 5 and 8 years participate in formal swimming lessons outside of school, with a 75% drop-off in participation after 8 years old.

The newly released AR Interactive - National Guide to Public Pools & Aquatic Centres 2023, produced in conjunction with Australian Swim Schools Association (ASSA) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation, has been designed for display year-round in public pools and aquatic centres working in partnership with families and caregivers, children’s first and most influential educators, to communicate water safety awareness and prioritise the urgent uptake of learn to swim programs as well as opportunities for families and children to take part in ASSA’s SAFERWater Warriors Campaign which involves five superheroes who all have powers that align with SAFERSwimming Layers of Protection messages — constant adult supervision, proper barriers, swimming and safety skills, emergency action plan — with fun and exciting animated activities, with the aim of keeping children and patrons safer around water and helping to lower the drowning statistics spike.

Royal Life Saving Society - Australia has warned a generation of non-swimming children could turn into a generation of non-swimming adults at increased risk of drowning, with new data showing a significant decrease in formal swimming lessons.

I would like to thank ASSA and our corporate sponsors for urging parents to enrol children in formal swimming lessons, increase water and sun safety awareness, drowning prevention strategies, education and action to ensure that these children don’t become a generation of non-swimmers.”

147,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Resources Safety and Health Queensland has issued compliance directives to mine operators after a series of serious incidents at Central Queensland coalmines involving mobile equipment operating on coal stockpiles. Per the directives, operators must take action to ensure risk to workers is managed to an acceptable level. The directives follow three recently reported incidents in Queensland where mobile equipment being operated by workers has sunk into voids that have developed in stockpiles.

The first incident occurred late last year and resulted in RSHQ issuing a safety bulletin on 16 December 2022 that made recommendations to reduce risks arising from these operations. The more recent incidents remain under investigation. Resources Minister Scott Stewart welcomed the RSHQ putting the industry on notice about the hazards involved with operating mobile equipment on stockpiles.

Resources Minister Scott Stewart welcomed RSHQ putting the industry on notice about hazards involved with operating mobile equipment on stockpiles. “The health and safety of all workers is paramount for a Palaszczuk Labor government. Regardless of the industry, every worker deserves to come home safely from their job,” Stewart said.

Stewart also welcomed the regulator’s ongoing focus to ensure operations involving heavy mobile equipment are conducted in a way that does not expose workers to an unacceptable level of risk, including issuing a safety bulletin. RSHQ CEO Mark Stone said the action taken by the regulator is consistent with its compliance and enforcement policy, combining education and corrective action.

“The compliance directives issued by the inspectorate require mine sites to take action within a specified timeframe. I expect for many operations, responding to the directive will validate that their safety systems are good. For some, the directive will help expose deficiencies and lead to improved risk control and learnings,” Stone said.

In recent months, Queensland and New South Wales mining regulators have published safety bulletins alerting industry to incidents and hazards arising from the operation of dozers and heavy mobile equipment. Recommendations have been made to site senior executives that they take steps to ensure their systems are effective.

148,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The federal government has invested $3.9 million to support Lung Foundation Australia to reduce the rates of occupational respiratory disease in Australia and eliminate silicosis, an incurable lung disease caused by long-term exposure to silica dust. Nearly one in four engineered stone workers who have been in the industry prior to 2018 have been diagnosed with silicosis or other silica dust-related diseases and this number is expected to rise.

The grant will focus on prevention and awareness, strengthen the dust disease evidence base and build research capability. The grant will also fund targeted education and communication activities to prevent workers from developing dust diseases and raise awareness of the risks of working in dust-generating industries, such as construction, tunnelling, mining and quarrying.

Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care Ged Kearney MP said that while silicosis is a preventable disease, it continues to affect too many workers, with numbers likely to increase. “Workers deserve to feel safe and protected on the job and go on to live happy, healthy lives with their loved ones — not deal with the consequences of a preventable and incurable respiratory condition. Raising awareness and developing better coordinated care strategies is an integral part of tackling the problem. There’s work to be done and this is a step in the right direction,” Kearney said.

The investment will be used to develop a National Rapid Response Protocol, establish a research forum and expand National Safe Work Month to raise awareness of occupational lung disease. The funding will also go towards expanding Lung Foundation Australia’s Respiratory Care Nurse telephone-based service, the development and implementation of a Silicosis Care Management Plan for use by GPs and the creation of a single, centralised hub to provide affected workers and their families with the information, support and expert advice they need.

149,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Queensland Mining and Energy Union has called on the Queensland Government to get serious about prosecuting coal companies and individuals whose actions have led to workers being killed or severely injured at work after a series of tragic fatalities in the industry. The Union has launched a campaign urging mineworkers and community members to write to the Minister for Resources, Scott Stewart, and Minister for Industrial Relations, Grace Grace, asking for justice for their colleagues killed at work.

Stephen Smyth, MEU Queensland Distract President, said it is time for Ministers in the Queensland Government to get serious about prosecuting companies whose workers are killed on the job as everyone has the right to return safely from work each day. Smyth called for guidelines for prosecutions to be reviewed and to take into account the need for mining workers, families and communities to see justice being pursued over fatalities in their industry.

“I’m sick of sitting down with the families of members we’ve lost and trying to explain why no one has been held accountable. Grieving families and communities hear time and time again that no charges are laid, or charges are laid and dropped, or cases are indefinitely held up. In 2020 five miners at the Grosvenor Mine were horrifically burned in an explosion, and despite a Board of Inquiry finding Anglo American knew gas emissions generated by the rate of production exceeded drainage capacity, no-one has been prosecuted. After David Routledge was crushed by a wall at Middlemount Mine in 2019 charges initially brought against a senior manager were dropped. Charges laid against the mine operator and a senior mine executive after the death of Brad Duxbury at the Carborough Downs Mine in 2019 were rejected due to a legal technicality,” Smyth said.

In 2021, Graham Dawson was crushed by a collapsing rood at Crinum Mine, and despite risk management plans falling short and the failure to deploy strata monitoring devices, no charges have been laid. Dawson’s daughters Katrina and Leesh are supporting the Justice for Miners campaign and urging the government to ensure mining companies are held accountable when they allow death and injury to occur on their watch. “Our father lost his life working underground. For families like ours, the consequences of a tragic workplace accident burden us every day,” Katrina and Leesh said.

150,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Victorian Government has launched the Women of Colour Executive Leadership Program to help culturally diverse women across the state reach their leadership aspirations. The program will support 20 diverse women — including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women — to upskill and navigate the distinct barriers that women of colour face in advancing their careers through workshops, mentoring and coaching over seven months. It will also help women to complete an individual strategic challenge project and improve their board capabilities.

The state government is investing $1 million in leadership programs for women, with the Women of Colour Executive Leadership Program one of four initiatives announced in 2022 to help women gain leadership roles and build more-inclusive workplaces. The program is designed by Women of Colour Australia, with an advisory group of Women of Colour leaders including First Nations leaders from Women’s Business. Under the program, workplaces of the participants will contribute a one-off $10,000 co-payment to help identify ways they can strengthen diversity in the workplace and be more inclusive.

Barriers to women’s leadership are not about lack of ability but systemic issues — including workplace racial discrimination — that limit women’s leadership progression. In June 2021, Women of Colour Australia released the findings of its ‘Women of Colour in the Australian Workplace’ survey, which looked at what was needed to improve women’s experiences in workplaces and boardrooms.

The survey respondents included 543 women, of which 7% identified as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and named having access to executive leadership programs as a key priority to advancing their career. Applications to join the program are now open until 28 February 2023, with the program to run from May.

Minister for Women Natalie Hutchins encouraged all culturally diverse women from across the state to apply to the program. “Diverse women are ready to lead, they are capable and ambitious. This program presents a real opportunity for businesses to do more than just talk about supporting diversity and inclusion — it’s an opportunity to show it,” Hutchins said.

151,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A new report by the McKell Institute has revealed that the average frontline worker has not had a real pay rise for more than a decade. The report, A Decade of Wages Lost, sheds light on the scale and impact of the nation’s nominal wage increase and its recent decline. The report shows annual real wage declines over the last 18 months have left wages lower than they were 10 years prior.

The report also found that the average real wage in Australia is lower now than at any point since September 2011. Some occupations, including nurses and corrections officers, have lost almost $3000 in real wages compared to a decade ago. Even teachers, who have experienced a small real wage increase, have seen wages rise by just 0.6% in a decade. Queensland experienced the greatest real wage decline in Australia at 2.5%, while Australia’s two largest states were on par with average real wages in 2012. They have since fallen in NSW, while Victoria has among the highest in the country.

Report author and CEO of the McKell Institute Michael Buckland warned policymakers to be cautious about placing downward pressure on wages. Buckland added that real wages are at their lowest level in years, with the nominal wage growth over the last few years wiped out by inflation.

“Workers across Australia have been exposed to the onset of inflation and low wage growth and will be worse off for years to come. Paramedics, registered nurses, correctional officers and firefighters are getting paid less, and have a lower standard of living today than they did 10 years ago. Government policies have been driving anaemic wage growth. This has included public sector wage freezes, inaction on wage theft and an expansion of the gig economy without adequate regulation. The federal government will no doubt prioritise reducing inflation, but it must also balance this with recovering a decade of lost wages for workers. It will take years to regain the wage growth that has been fought for and now lost,” Buckland said.","The report shows annual real wage declines over the last 18 months have left wages lower than they were 10 years prior.

152,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"WorkSafe Victoria has revealed that 123 companies and directors were fined for flouting workplace safety laws in 2022, and warned employers who continue to ignore well-known safety measures that they risk facing similar fines. Fourteen companies were hit with six-figure penalties for breaching the Occupational Health and Safety Act, with the total of all fines imposed by the courts $5,588,750. Of the 123 fines imposed in 2022, 35 duty holders were prosecuted and fined for offences involving working at heights. This was followed by matters involving inadequate or absent guarding (23) and unsafe, or unsafe use of, machinery (18) and forklifts (11). Multiple employers were also fined for offences involving electric shocks, unsafe crane use and failing to keep young workers between the ages of 16 and 20 safe.

Construction (47) and manufacturing (36) matters accounted for two-thirds of workplace safety prosecutions; these industries also accounted for more than a quarter of all accepted workers compensation claims in 2022. A third of prosecutions (43) involved employers in regional Victoria, with offences detected in workplaces stretching from Mildura to Portland and Wodonga to Bairnsdale. WorkSafe Executive Director of Health and Safety Narelle Beer said the outcomes showed that employers are still ignoring their basic legal obligations when it comes to using established solutions for common workplace safety risks.

“Training workers in the safe operation of equipment, using a passive fall prevention device when working at heights, ensuring machines are appropriately guarded and maintained, and erecting physical barriers to separate pedestrians from mobile plant are all proven ways to reduce workplace injuries and deaths. But having the knowledge is not enough. Employers must actively implement measures to make their workplaces safe,” said Beer, adding that the lack of care shown for some young workers was particularly shocking.

In December, Langwarrin carpentry company Topline Carpentry South East Pty Ltd was fined $130,000 after a 16-year-old apprentice was injured twice in a day, sustaining a badly cut hand when a power saw was thrown to him. The worker continued to work one-handed before being shot in the head by a nail gun while constructing a door frame, with the nail penetrating 20 mm into his brain.

“This horrific matter highlights the vulnerability of young workers. It is vital that those who are new to the workforce are adequately supervised and presented with examples of what a safety-first attitude looks like from their employer and other experienced workers. Employers are also responsible for fostering a supportive environment where workers are encouraged to speak up or ask questions when they have safety concerns,” Beer said.

There were many other WorkSafe prosecutions in 2022, including road tanker manufacturer Marshall Lethlean Industries Pty Ltd; the company was fined $600,000 after a young apprentice died from asphyxiation while working inside a tanker at a Cranbourne West factory in 2018. Peter Stoitse Transport Pty Ltd was also fined ($490,000) for a separate incident, in which a truck driver died in Gippsland in 2018.

Stone importer Australia Rong Hua Fu Pty Ltd (RHF Stone) was fined $475,000 after a worker was fatally crushed at a Dingley Valley warehouse in 2020. Additionally, Best Benchtop and Stone Pty Ltd was fined $325,000 after a worker was crushed and killed by stone slabs weighing more than six tonnes in 2020.","Of the 123 fines imposed in 2022, 35 duty holders were prosecuted and fined for offences involving working at heights.
Multiple employers were also fined for offences involving electric shocks, unsafe crane use and failing to keep young workers between the ages of 16 and 20 safe.
Construction (47) and manufacturing (36) matters accounted for two-thirds of workplace safety prosecutions; these industries also accounted for more than a quarter of all accepted workers compensation claims in 2022.
Employers must actively implement measures to make their workplaces safe,” said Beer, adding that the lack of care shown for some young workers was particularly shocking.

153,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"It has been estimated that contaminated food caused approximately 5.4 million cases of gastroenteritis annually in Australia. Australians are also throwing away food which is worth $5.2 billion a year, including more than $1.1 billion worth of fruit and vegetables and $872.5 million worth of fresh meat and fish. One contributing factor for food illness and waste is poor cold chain management.*

Correct cold chain practice is also critical for exports. The USA FDA, for instance, will assess the safety of the Australian cold chain when deciding whether to allow perishable food to be imported, and exports to Asia are likewise partly determined by the quality of the Australian cold chain operations.

The Australian Cold Chain Guidelines for Food 2017 details best practice recommendations for transport, logistic and safety requirements to ensure the safety and quality of chilled and frozen foods and minimise food illness and waste, which is critically important to consumers, regulators, the food industry and the Australian economy. It is the primary focus of the newly released AR Interactive - Food Manufacturing Industry Guide to Safety 2022/23 produced in conjunction with Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ), Australian Food Cold Chain Council (AFCCC) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation. It assists in recognising and controlling the key hazards with the latest Regulatory Guidelines and Framework focused on proactive prevention of injury and ill-health, together with food safety standards and control systems.

The AR Interactive - Food Manufacturing Industry Guide to Safety 2022/23 is developed with interactive augmented reality (AR) capabilities for use with a smart device, using the free Pro-Vis AR App from the App Store or Google Play to download tools and resources to plan how the cold chain conditions for a food can be met by talking with contractors, customers and suppliers, including in relation to record keeping, logs and process documentation; implement an ongoing program of training for personnel in cold chain handling, covering housekeeping, hygienic discipline and process control requirements; and continuously review policies and operating procedures as part of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) and internal Food Safety Programs.

154,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Insurance and Care NSW (icare) has opened a Dust Disease Care Health Screening Clinic, which has relocated to icare’s headquarters at 321 Kent Street, Sydney. The clinic offers lung health examinations to employers, workers and retirees who have been exposed to hazardous dust in a NSW workplace. It also facilitates early identification of dust diseases and monitoring of disease progression, and provides education to at-risk workers about personal protection against dust diseases.

Richard Harding, CEO and Managing Director of icare, said the new clinic was designed considering the needs of clients who will use the facility, as well as the needs of the staff running the facility. The lung health examinations this state-of-the-art clinic will provide to people who’ve been exposed to hazardous dust are life changing. Better case identification is the key to enabling early intervention, which is critical to ensuring better health outcomes for workers exposed to dangerous dust,” Harding said.

icare’s Dust Diseases Care team will also be working at icare’s headquarters, which will bring them closer to the people they serve and help ensure that icare is offering the best lung health monitoring services. icare, through Dust Diseases Care, offers financial support to those diagnosed with a disability from a dust disease and their dependents, in addition to medical treatment and services such as walking aids, home modifications and at-home nursing care. There’s also vocational re-training, so they are able to leave the industry if they choose and embark on another career.

Alongside the new clinic, icare will continue to provide screening via the mobile ‘lung bus’ which travelled across NSW in 2022, providing lung screening services to almost 1500 workers. As the existing lung bus nears the end of its useful life, icare is in the process of commissioning a new unit and is also undertaking a scoping study to assess the potential for an expanded mobile service in the future.

Last year, the DDC Health Screening Clinic provided services to 550 clients; of those, 199 employers arranged appointments for 297 employers and 253 clients are no longer working in a dusty workplace. icare’s Dust Disease Care currently supports 1810 workers who have developed a dust disease because of harmful dust exposure in an NSW workplace, and 3451 dependents of those impacted.

155,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Wage Inspectorate Victoria has launched a range of online learning resources as part of a pilot program to increase awareness and understanding of Victoria’s long service leave and wage theft laws. The free e-learning modules for employers and workers aim to improve understanding of and compliance with workplace rights and obligations.

Taking less than 15 minutes to complete, the modules will be trialled over the coming months to test the effectiveness of e-learning to embed knowledge about workplace laws, with more topics to be added if the pilot is successful. After finishing the courses, users are encouraged to complete a short survey to provide their feedback and rate the extent to which their knowledge about long service leave and wage theft has improved. Robert Hortle, Commissioner of Wage Inspectorate Victoria, said the e-learning resources provide another avenue for employers and workers to learn about the law, and are part of the Wage Inspectorate’s commitment to trialling different ways of improving compliance with the law.

“We know there is a variety of learning preferences out there, and that’s why we provide support through multiple channels — we have fact sheets, videos, frequently asked questions, a helpline and now online learning. Being informed is the first step to being compliant,” Hortle said.

Designed with stakeholder input, and accessibility in mind, the modules feature audio and interactive elements to provide an overview of the law and allow practitioners or people with specific questions to jump to topics they need help with. The long service leave module deals with topics like determining when Victoria’s Long Service Leave Act applies, how leave accrues and when it can be taken. It also covers how workers can recoup money they’re owed and resolve issues with their boss.

The wage theft modules address the legal definition of wage theft, how to address wage theft, the process of reporting it and the support available from the Wage Inspectorate. An employer-focused module provides information on who can be liable for wage theft offences and can help organisations understand their role in preventing a corporate culture that could lead to a wage theft offence being tolerated.

In November 2022, the Wage Inspectorate filed wage theft charges against a Macedon restaurant and its officer, making the first criminal wage theft charges filed under the Victorian Wage Theft Act 2020. In 2022, more than 280,000 Victorians accessed educative information on the Wage Inspectorate’s website. More than 12,000 people also called the regulator and their questions helped to inform the content for the new e-learning modules. “Visits to our website over the past year have demonstrated strong demand for online learning, and we hope to attract even more visitors with these new resources,” Hortle said.

156,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Truck drivers and members of the freight industry have been encouraged to participate in consultation to improve heavy vehicle rest stops across New South Wales. Minister for Regional Transport and Roads Sam Farraway said the initiative is important because it will help the NSW Government address gaps in the rest stop network and ensure facilities meet the needs of drivers.

“The road freight industry is critical to our state’s economy, from big business and farmers to retailers and consumers. We all rely on these drivers to ensure our goods get to us quickly and efficiently. It is important that we provide quality facilities that support heavy vehicle drivers and improve road safety. Up north in Clybucca we have installed outdoor fitness equipment for truckies to use so they can stretch and get exercise in after a long period on the road,” Farraway said.

Farraway forecasts that the NSW freight task is expected to grow by 34% in 2061, with the state government doing everything to support this growth by ensuring that the supply chain is efficient. “We want to hear from the road freight industry, particularly heavy vehicle drivers on what they need and expect at rest stops across NSW and where additional facilities are needed. We have several projects underway investigating, planning, designing and constructing heavy vehicle rest stop improvements. Industry feedback is guiding this work to ensure it meets the current and future needs of heavy vehicle drivers and the growing freight task,” Farraway said.

The Livestock, Bulk and Rural Carriers Association President Wade Lewis welcomed the progression of the NSW Heavy Vehicle Rest Stop program, which aims to provide new and upgraded rest areas for heavy vehicles on key freight routes in NSW. Lewis said the program highlights the NSW Government’s commitment to engage with industry to develop a practical and capable rest area network.

“Rest areas are a vital component of the heavy vehicle task and support drivers to manage fatigue and comply with driving hours regulation,” Lewis said.

Consultation will be open until 28 February 2023.

Head of SafeWork NSW Natasha Mann said that despite the rising usage of cobots and the risks involved, there is a gap in the current workplace health and safety framework around how workplaces can safely engage with them. “The potential WHS risks cobots present are reasonably well-known overseas, with several cases of workers being injured in cobot-related incidents. The world-first guidelines directly address this gap by offering practical guidance for preventing robot-related injuries from occurring, and in turn, curbing potential WHS incidents in the future,” Mann said.

The guidelines offer easy-to-adopt strategies and resources to plan and design cobot-safe workplaces, mitigate hazards and minimise harm, and are designed to be used on a strategic level for business and an operational level for workers. The guidelines are part of a research project to identify the key risks of working with cobots, and develop a set of practical guidelines for working safely with them.

“The research informing the guidelines included identifying WHS risks of working with cobots, a study to explore human attitudes and perceptions about how safe design can be supported and enabled, and co-design sessions to support safe implementation,” Mann said.

158,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Concreters across New South Wales have been reminded to incorporate regular inspections, maintenance and testing of equipment into their routines, following a spate of concrete placing equipment incidents. Acting Head of SafeWork NSW John Tansey said concrete pours are hazardous operations and concrete placing equipment including concrete pumps must be serviced and functioning properly before any work starts. Between 2017 and 2020, SafeWork NSW Inspectors attended approximately 60 incidents, including one fatality and a further 17 involving serious injuries, many of which were caused by malfunctioning concrete placing equipment.

“Recently there have been multiple occurrences of workers being injured by concrete line hose which has either blocked or burst and expelled concrete at significant force, as well as equipment impacting with powerlines, scaffolding and other infrastructure,” Tansey said.

During a pour at a site in Wagga, a concrete pump connection point burst after a blockage and a member of the public’s car was sprayed with concrete as they drove past the site. In another incident at Greystanes, a boom pump extension arm hit overhead powerlines and caused an arc explosion and current which travelled along a boundary fence and blew a neighbouring property’s water main.

“It is very lucky nobody was seriously injured during these events and a timely reminder that working with concrete can be dangerous. Before work commences it is essential workers verify if the terrain is suitable for concrete placing equipment operations and note hazards such as overhead powerlines and recent trenching. Always ensure you have safe work systems in place and that anyone performing high-risk work is adequately licensed, trained and supervised when doing so,” Tansey said.

159,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"People who are off work due to injury or illness are at higher risk of later suicide and intentional self-harm, according to an international study by Monash University School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine. Researchers collated findings from 47 studies published over 20 years from 16 different countries to examine the relationship between a disabling work injury or illness and later suicide or self-harm.

Published in PLOS Global Public Health, the review found that the risk of suicide was elevated in people with workers compensation claims, on long-term sick leave and receiving disability pensions. Lead researcher Professor Alex Collie said this suggests a need for governments and employers to focus on identifying workers at greatest risk of suicide and put more effort into suicide prevention.

“We found consistent evidence of a link between being off work sick or injured and later suicide. We see this link in many countries and in people with different types of health conditions,” Collie said.

Of the 47 studies included in the review, 44 found that people with work injury or illness were at greater risk of suicide or self-harm, with one study showing a protective relationship and two showing no relationship. Researchers also found a number of things that increase the risk of suicide, such as being off work for a long time, younger age, living alone, having a history of poor health or a mental health condition. People who had very long periods off work were at much higher risk; being out of work with injury or illness for weeks, months or years was linked with an increased risk of suicide and self-harm.

“But time away from work doesn’t necessarily reflect the severity of injury or illness. It may also indicate that the person has received poor quality medical treatment, has delayed seeking help or has other behaviours that can affect recovery such as substance misuse,” Collie said.

The review’s authors suggest that programs and services designed to reduce the duration of time off work may also reduce the risk of suicide and self-harm. Collie said that suicide prevention should not be left just to the healthcare system, adding that there are opportunities through systems that support sick or injured workers, like workers compensation and social security, to identify people who are at higher risk and to provide supports and services that reduce those risks.

“When it comes to reducing time off work, we know what good interventions look like. This review adds another dimension and suggests by supporting sick and injured workers to return to work, we may also be able to reduce the risk of suicide,” Collie said.

The researchers also identified some gaps in the research literature — only two Australian studies were identified and there were no studies of suicide prevention interventions.","Researchers collated findings from 47 studies published over 20 years from 16 different countries to examine the relationship between a disabling work injury or illness and later suicide or self-harm.

The Framework draws on conclusive international evidence that wellbeing is identified as central to children’s learning and development.

The newly released AR Interactive - National Guide to Early Childhood Education 2022/23 produced in conjunction with Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia (PANDA), Australian Swim Schools Association (ASSA), Eczema Association Australasia (EAA) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation has been designed for use by early childhood educators working in partnership with families and caregivers, children’s first and most influential educators. Educators’ practices and the relationships they form with children and families have a significant effect on children’s wellbeing, strong sense of connection, optimism and engagement which enables children to develop a positive attitude to learning.

Wellbeing is the primary focus of the National Guide to Early Childhood Education 2022/23, which has become central to policies, frameworks and programs concerned with enhancing the quality of children’s lives and establishing positive life trajectories. Wellbeing is necessary for children to flourish and thrive, and the children most likely to experience school success are those with strong social and emotional foundations. Alarmingly, studies have suggested that as little as 40% of children begin their first formal year of schooling with the necessary wellbeing skills that enable them to maximise their full learning potential.*

The scope of this Guide’s review is less about examining the array of definitions and conceptual parameters of wellbeing, but rather about identifying those features most commonly attributed to positive wellbeing trajectories; the observational frameworks currently available to assess and support educators in the progressive development of these key skills across the birth-to-five-years life trajectory encompassing learning environments and responsive interactions that support development of wellbeing.

162,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"SafeWork NSW Inspectors are conducting compliance operations to help protect food delivery riders, following the introduction of new safety laws on 1 January 2023. Acting Head of SafeWork NSW John Tansey said the NSW Government will continue to liaise with industry and riders on the changes, which include new requirements to ensure all riders are equipped with high visibility personal protective equipment (PPE), receive comprehensive training, and are competent to do the work.

Tansey said SafeWork Inspectors have already issued warnings to a number of riders who were not wearing their supplied high visibility vests when delivering food. SafeWork also took steps to improve rider safety on 1 July 2022, when it became law for food delivery booking providers to supply their riders with PPE.

On 1 January 2023, it became law for riders to wear the supplied PPE, which is a high-visibility vest and food bag, and carry a training verification record. All riders found to not be wearing their PPE will face a $144 fine for each offence. After a series of food delivery rider fatalities at the end of 2020, the NSW Government set up a Food Delivery Rider Taskforce, established a high-profile education and compliance program across Sydney and introduced new laws that apply to all delivery platforms.

“These reforms are about keeping riders safer on our roads. We now have the strongest safety environment for food delivery platforms and riders anywhere in the world and will continue to work with industry to ensure a culture where people and safety comes first,” Tansey said.

The WHS Amendment (Food Delivery Riders) Regulation 2022 states that all food delivery platforms must: provide riders with induction training before they allow a rider to work for their platform; provide each rider with a training record verifying that the rider has successfully completed induction training; and maintain records of high-visibility PPE provision and training records of delivery riders.

All riders are now legally required to use or wear the PPE that has been provided to them while delivering food or drink, and must produce their training record if requested to by a SafeWork NSW Inspector or NSW police officer. Food delivery riders will face penalties and fines if they cannot show that they have met these requirements.

163,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"In October 2022, the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) surveyed thousands of members across a range of industries; analysis of the 2656 complete responses revealed shocking statistics of standards and access to amenities for both men and women in the electrical trades. Nationwide, the survey found that half of surveyed workers don’t have amenities that are always cleaned regularly, one-third of surveyed workers don’t have access to gendered amenities, and one-quarter of surveyed workers don’t always have access to toilet paper. The survey also revealed that one in five workers don’t always have running water in their amenities, while one in six workers don’t have access to any onsite amenities.

Following these findings, the ETU called on the federal government to establish a review into setting minimum health and safety standards for workplace amenities. ETU Acting National Secretary Michael Wright said having access to hygienic, reliable and adequate loos at work is a health and safety requirement and should be a no-brainer. “White-collar workers expect these basic standards, yet for workers in our industries, there’s still no guarantee of a usable toilet,” Wright said.

The survey found that the situation is worse for women, revealing many gender disparities. One in five women reportedly still don’t have access to sanitary bins in their workplace; women are also 8–10% less likely to have access to gendered and/or permanent bathrooms compared with their male colleagues, except in manufacturing and mining sectors. WA, NSW and SA were the worst overall for providing female-only amenities. Nearly half of the female respondents said they’ve raised an issue in their workplace about inadequate amenities compared with less than 30% of men.

Wright said that the substandard amenities are also affecting the participation of women in the electrical trades.

“We have a national sparkie shortage just when we need more of them than ever as Australia embarks on its renewable energy transition. How can we expect to boost numbers if we’re discriminating against half the potential workforce? We can’t afford to exclude an entire gender of workers if we’re going to build the Australia of the future,” Wright said.

Manufacturing and mining were the best performing industries, with over 85% of workers having access to permanent gendered amenities onsite compared to a national average of 64%. Only half of the surveyed lift industry workers had onsite amenities, while a third had permanent gendered amenities. Transmission and distribution workers also reported over 30% having no onsite amenities. Only half had access to gendered amenities of any description.

Western Australian workers had the best amenity access of any state, due to nearly 30% of WA respondents working in mining. However, women in WA had some of the lowest access to female-only bathrooms. The Northern Territory, despite having higher concentrations in industries like transmission and distribution, offered permanent toilets to over 90% of workers, almost all of which were gendered. All other states were roughly in line with national averages for amenity access figures across the board; however, the ACT stood out with poor access to permanent amenities.","Nationwide, the survey found that half of surveyed workers don’t have amenities that are always cleaned regularly, one-third of surveyed workers don’t have access to gendered amenities, and one-quarter of surveyed workers don’t always have access to toilet paper.

164,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Every year, 190 Australians working in the construction industry take their own lives. This means we lose a colleague every second day to suicide*.

The primary focus of the newly released AR Interactive – Power, Electrical & Renewable Energy Guide to Safety 2022/23 endorsed by the NSCA Foundation and supported by Before You Dig Australia (BYDA) is to provide tools and resources to enable those conducting a business or undertaking to take a prevention-led strategic approach to managing mental health and wellbeing, and build capacity for a productive mentally healthy workplace that supports workers and helps break the stigma and discrimination that often surrounds this topic.

This focus is particularly in light of the model work health and safety (WHS) laws which now include regulations on psychosocial hazards and a new model Code of Practice Managing Psychosocial Hazards at Work. This guide is an overview of the Australian mental health workforce policy landscape, which varies across jurisdictions, however has commonalities in its aims and principles, as mental injury claims continue to increase.

Australian construction workers are six times more likely to die from suicide, with young workers and apprentices more than two times more likely to take their own lives than other young Australian men. Mental injury claims have grown significantly, from 9% for the period prior to 2009 to currently 13%, and in the next 10 years are predicted to grow to 33% of workers compensation claims^.

Exposure to psychosocial hazards, and the risk of psychological injury as a result, is a serious problem. Mental health and safety is just as important as the physical health and safety of all those working in the electrical sector. Addressing psychosocial hazards is as crucial for the health and safety of workers as when someone is experiencing poor mental health, this may contribute to workplace accidents and injuries, and reduce productivity. When managing mental health risks onsite, it must be managed in the same way as other hazards are managed onsite: identify the hazard, assess the risk, control the risk using the hierarchy of controls and monitor and review the control for effectiveness.

Distributed to electricians, electrical contractors and wholesalers, power and utility providers, the AR Interactive – Power, Electrical & Renewable Energy Guide to Safety 2022/23 is developed with interactive augmented reality (AR) capabilities for use with a smart device, via the free Pro-Vis AR App to download resources such as videos and 3D animations for users to engage effectively on matters relating to mental health and wellbeing conversations; supportive discussions that address key strategic actions and procedures which aim to reduce the impact of industry-specific risk factors and promotion of protective factors.

Pro-Visual Publishing CEO John Hutchings said: “Mental health and safety is just as important as the physical health and safety of all those working in the electrical sector viewed through the framework of risk management, protecting all workers from psychological workplace hazards. Preventing psychological harm is an essential part of creating a healthy and safe workplace. On average, work-related psychological injuries have longer recovery times, higher costs and require more time away from work when compared with physical injuries.

Health and safety strategies and accident prevention measures need to be individualised and adapted to the type of worker most likely to be at risk and shaping a culture of safety for young workers and apprentices. This vital free workplace safety initiative would not be possible without the ongoing support from our corporate sponsors and industry associations.”

165,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A report from the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre (BCEC) has found that Australian mining companies have a stronger focus on the physical health and safety of employees compared to employee mental health and wellbeing, followed by a respectful workplace culture. The report was part of a collaborative project led by the Centre for Transformative Work Design based at Curtin’s Future of Work Institute (FOWI), and examined employee wellbeing in the mining sector. It found that while the mining industry has made progress in supporting and prioritising employee wellbeing as well as preventing and addressing sexual harassment, there are still some areas for further development.

The report revealed that only 22% of mining sector workers were very satisfied with their overall job, with employees experiencing poor job satisfaction, job security and job prospects compared to other industries. By also reviewing secondary evidence from the Australian Human Rights Commission, it found the mining sector is one of the worst five industries in the country in relation to sexual harassment issues, with 40% of workers and 74% of female workers reporting sexual harassment in the last five years.

Principal Research Fellow Associate Professor Astghik Mavisakalyan from BCEC said the report findings should help mining sector companies to recognise changes that improve respect and workplace culture. According to Mavisakalyan, the Australian mining sector is a major contributor to investment, jobs, exports and government revenues, yet faces unique challenges associated with remote working and travel, shift work, temporary accommodation, exposure to health and safety hazards and a male-dominated workforce that potentially contribute to poor employee mental health and wellbeing.

“The report develops a unique index to capture the prioritisation of employee health and wellbeing based on mining companies’ public reports and found many mining companies, particularly those that are larger or have women at the helm, are prioritising wellbeing. However, only 33% refer to loneliness, social connection, or isolation in their reports, and only 50% of mining companies refer to sexual harassment, assault and sexism,” Mavisakalyan said.

Mavisakalyan also said the mining industry rated the lowest among all Australian industries for job satisfaction. While mining sector workers experienced good physical health and were more satisfied with their jobs now compared to 15 years ago, the number of very satisfied workers was the lowest of all industries. The report showed that the levels of high distress of mining sector workers has risen in the last decade, from 9% in 2009 to 15% in 2019. John Curtin Distinguished Professor Sharon Parker from FOWI said it is important to create positive environments that support employees’ mental health and wellbeing, as well as their physical safety.

“Identifying and supporting employees who are experiencing poor mental health is an important step, but we also need to proactively create healthy work. This means developing work cultures in which women are welcome and accepted, as well as, for all workers, having meaningful jobs with decent rosters, acceptable levels of job demands, and supportive managers,” Parker said.

According to Parker, having anti-harassment and mental health policies is necessary but not sufficient. These policies must be backed up by on-the-ground support for the policies, such as effective systems for reporting harassment, and education and training of managers to effectively implement the policies.

The Centre for Transformative Work Design has also released a literature review report, which can be accessed online. These are the first two reports released for the Mental Awareness, Respect and Safety in the Mining Industry (MARS) Program, which was commissioned by the WA Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS) in April 2022.","The report revealed that only 22% of mining sector workers were very satisfied with their overall job, with employees experiencing poor job satisfaction, job security and job prospects compared to other industries.

166,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Palaszczuk government has reminded Queenslanders to be safe on quad bikes, with a new campaign highlighting the fact that they are reportedly the biggest killers on Queensland farms. Industrial Relations Minister Grace Grace said she wanted everyone to think about safety before using a quad bike. According to Grace, more than 50 Queenslanders have died using quad bikes over the last 10 years, and many of these were children; some weren’t wearing helmets, some were children using adult-sized bikes, and others didn’t have the right training.

“Quad bikes can be a really useful tool, and great fun too, but I don’t want any tragedies because basic safety rules are overlooked. The simple steps outlined in the campaign could avoid this holiday being one to remember for all the wrong reasons,” Grace said.

The campaign emphasises five steps quad bike users can follow to make sure they come home safe. These include always wearing a helmet, ensuring kids only use kids’ bikes, and undertaking quad bike training, as even the most experienced riders need to be prepared for the unexpected. The campaign also warns against doubling, as doubling on a single-seat quad bike can make quad bikes unstable. Heavy loads and attachments can also make quad bikes unstable.

“We know these simple steps go a long way to keeping people safe on quad bikes. But we also know that this campaign alone won’t tackle this issue: it’s just one part of our strategy to reduce the tragic deaths and injuries associated with these machines,” Grace said.

The Queensland Government is also ensuring compliance with its laws, using enforcement optics when those laws are ignored, educating employers, workers and families about how to use quad bikes safely, and raising awareness of the serious consequences if they don’t. Earlier this year, the Queensland Government also sought community feedback on proposed new safety measures for quad bike usage under the Work Health and Safety Regulation — including mandatory helmet use, no kids allowed on adult machines, restrictions on carrying certain passengers, and training.

“We’re currently considering this feedback and looking at possible regulatory changes in 2023. We will continue to keep industry and the community informed on this process,” Grace said.

167,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Burnout and overwork can sometimes feel synonymous with the lead-up to the holiday season; given that companies often ask employees to take annual leave over this time period, it can seem like an odd arrangement when the amount of hard work they feel they need to do sometimes feels like they need to ‘make up’ for this. Dr Andrew Dhaenens, Lecturer at UNSW Business School’s School of Management and Governance, said this can sometimes be because of an individual’s ‘drive’ to ‘finish up’ for the end of the year and celebrate that achievement.

“End-of-year celebrations and similar rituals are reflective of that. In short, being able to shake off the events you would like to leave behind and celebrate what you have done well as a team. When workplaces have positive cultures, everyone understands the rhythms of the business and shares in the celebrations and challenges together,” Dhaenens said.

But what happens when longer work hours leave employees feelings more burnt out than celebratory? According to Dhaenens, while the holidays away from work are recognised as a valuable time to practice self-care, the lead-up can trigger people to experience feelings of burnout. Dhaenens said this is because, in part, people naturally compartmentalise their identities between ‘work’ and ‘life’.

The Black Dog Institute defines burnout as “a form of emotional exhaustion that can occur in response to persistent and unrelenting stress”. If workers feel “exhausted, unable to concentrate and want to withdraw and disconnect from the world and those around them”, it could mean they are heading for burnout. “The rush we put ourselves through before the holidays is our way of making sure that we have the space to rest, recharge and detach. People spend time on holidays working on their mental health with rest, relaxation and reflection alongside their hobbies and travels, and they don’t want any leftover work to interfere with this,” Dhaenens said.

Dhaenens added that often work pace can match up with the pace of the industry that the worker has chosen to work in, as different industries can have different deadlines and expectations around dates in the calendar. “For education, it is around the school year, whereas for finance it might be separate fiscal year,” Dhaenens said.

According to Dhaenens, the issue of feeling overworked in the lead-up to the holiday season can be solved by both employees and managers working together to figure out clear goals and define end-of-year deadlines. “If you feel like your work rush is not sustainable, you should talk about expectations with your supervisors and co-workers in your developmental network. Busy seasons and holidays are really a product of our relationships at work and our reactions to these can be impacted, improved or even worsened, by conversations with others,” Dhaenens said.

Holidays can provide a natural distance to rest and recharge; in closing off stretches of work, everyone is forced to determine which tasks are most important — upon reflection, it may be a product of poor planning and limited resources. “Take the opportunity with holidays to sit down and have these conversations, about what you can and cannot do now and into the future,” Dhaenens said.

For managers, Dhaenens advised taking the opportunity to debrief, discuss non-negotiables and celebrate accomplishments with their team through social activities and more, in order to mitigate employee burnout during this time.

With working from home and hybrid work set to continue for many, it could impact stress levels when workers sabotage their own set boundaries. Many can relate to wanting to quickly check ‘just one work email,’ or respond to that notification, before disrupting their downtime. “When it comes to tools such as electronic calendars and IM platforms like Microsoft Teams and Slack, it does suggest limited options for conveying (and signalling) where we are and how we are working (or not). ‘Busy’ does not always mean busy,’ and ‘Out of Office’ is our only real signal that we are away on holidays or annual leave,” Dhaenens said.

Dhaenens noted that while there has been much discussion around flexibility in workplaces, this can reflect a real issue as people work in different places at different times. “Considering the ‘everything, everywhere, all at once’ sort of year we have all had, it can be very tempting to fall back into work cycles. Yet, there is so much evidence on benefits of taking time away on our wellbeing,” Dhaenens said.

Dhaenens, who co-founded the Hybrid Work Leadership research and knowledge centre, which operates out of UNSW Business School, said balancing considerations around work arrangement preferences is an issue companies continue to be concerned with, alongside turnover. Dhaenens and co-founder Professor Karin Sanders, UNSW Business School, are working with the industry to research the area, such as the impact of micromanagers on workers in the hybrid workplace.

“Our ongoing research continues to show that your perceptions of wellbeing at work — for example, how much support you think your manager is giving you, and how much learning and connection you feel is occurring, is a major factor in creating work-life balance and liking your workplace. From the manager down, your team should know the rhythms of work; the rest and reward after the busy times needs to be there. Take the opportunity to connect and celebrate together,” Dhaenens said.

Dhaenens said that while work is a big portion of our lives, it is not everything. He advised that if workplace leaders take the time to know their reports and their challenges, and work together to make their life better inside and outside work, everyone is going to get better results. If not (and if workers have the flexibility), it might be worth seeking employment elsewhere.

“While it is important to balance the fact that sometimes you need to ‘do the tough work’, not only to climb your career ladder, but to learn and grow, if the rewards are not there, it is simply not something that will be sustainable. Sometimes you get through to the other side of the holidays, and it really is a dusting off with a ‘Phew! Glad it is done’. Other times, it may be an ‘I’ll never do that again’. Because at the end of the day, taking time for annual leave gives us space to consider what is important. And sometimes, when you go on leave, that might mean you begin to reconsider if that environment is the right one for you to continue in,” Dhaenens said.","When workplaces have positive cultures, everyone understands the rhythms of the business and shares in the celebrations and challenges together,” Dhaenens said.

168,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Employers have been urged to review and revise onboarding processes for new employees to identify and mitigate psychosocial hazards as Australian states and territories face Safe Work Australia’s new Model Code of Practice. A survey of Australian managers and employees shows 65% have experienced feelings of stress or being overwhelmed and 50% reported feelings of isolation. Under the new Model Code, psychosocial hazards that are not alleviated or removed can become a risk that carries potential criminal action. Market research conducted by NewFocus was commissioned by service management software provider TOPdesk, and revealed a lack of resources and guidance for new employees. It also revealed that 76% of the 1000 respondents would fix their own issues if they had the right tools.

Organisational Psychologist Hayden Fricke said he believed the survey’s results reflect the different work arrangements and environments post-COVID. According to Fricke, the introduction of the new psychosocial hazards Model Code of Practice is likely to create huge change in the workplace and the survey could serve as a timely warning to organisations and leaders to adapt their onboarding processes to include tangible and measured support for employee mental health and wellbeing. Fricke said that while not all stress is bad, the right induction process and support will set an employee up for success.

“A combination of positive stress (known as eustress) and distress on the first day of a new job is normal; there should be more eustress and less distress at the end of a 90-day onboarding period if the onboarding process is managed well,” Fricke said.

TOPdesk General Manager Robert van der Gulik said that employees need to do better or face serious consequences. According to the Productivity Commission Mental Health Inquiry of 2020, mentally unhealthy workplaces already cost Australia up to $39 billion a year in lost participation. “When organisations provide a strong introduction to the workplace this makes employees’ lives easier and less stressful,” Van der Gulik said.

Changes to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) legislation have already passed in NSW and became operative from 1 October 2022; they will commence in Queensland in April 2023, with other states on track to introduce amendments. In Victoria, the proposed changes have been developed and are expected to be passed early next year.","Employers have been urged to review and revise onboarding processes for new employees to identify and mitigate psychosocial hazards as Australian states and territories face Safe Work Australia’s new Model Code of Practice.

169,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"When food delivery platform Deliveroo pulled out of Australia, it cited a tough business environment, but observers such as academics and the Transport Workers’ Union suspect that the company withdrew because of a court case that challenged its contract work model. Deliveroo claimed that there is too much competition in Australia’s on-demand food delivery sector, according to Dr Grief Taylor, a lecturer in the School of Management and Governance at UNSW Business School. “It certainly is a tightly contested (some might say ‘saturated’) market. The company argues that it just doesn’t make enough profit in its Australian subsidiary to continue,” Taylor said.

Deliveroo, which is headquartered in the UK and operates in other markets around the world, claimed its Australian business represented approximately 3% of the company’s gross transaction value (GTV) in the first half of this year. However, Taylor said there are suspicions that Deliveroo has ‘done a Foodora’ in exiting the Australian food delivery service market. Foodora, a smaller, less well-known food delivery platform, decided to wind up its Australian operations in 2018. The company gave a similar reason to Deliveroo at the time, stating it was shifting its focus “towards other markets where the company currently sees a higher potential for growth”.

“The reality was that the company had been taken to the federal court by the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) earlier that year over the highly controversial practice, widespread in the sector, of classifying its employees as ‘independent contractors’. When the ruling went against it, Foodora announced they were exiting the Australian market,” Taylor said.

Deliveroo faced a similar case last year, where one of its delivery riders, who had been fired for delivering too slowly, took his case to the Fair Work Commission (FWC). It ruled in the rider’s favour, saying there was enough evidence to support a claim that the rider should be considered an employee and not an independent contractor and was therefore entitled to compensation for unfair dismissal. Taylor said this had a number of implications for Deliveroo beyond this specific case. It was in danger of setting a precedent that could have re-categorised its entire rider workforce as employees, adding significant costs to its operations, as statutory minimums and contributions would apply.

The company appealed the ruling and in August, a Full Bench of the FWC ruled in favour of the company, citing a recent High Court decision in a similar case. Nevertheless, with the federal government threatening to legislate on this issue (alongside other challenges to the previous status quo across the platform sector), Taylor said it seems Deliveroo has decided to cut its losses by going into voluntary administration.

“It has pulled similar stunts in Europe this year, as regulators and policymakers begin to clamp down on the miscategorisation of workers in this sphere,” Taylor said.

According to Taylor, Deliveroo’s workforce has been left “high and dry” by the company’s sudden exit, as they are not classed as employees and therefore have few employment protections, including entitlement to retrenchment and compensation. Those who are owed money in wages are being categorised as “unsecured creditors” by KordaMentha, the firm in charge of the voluntary liquidation. Taylor said this means it’s likely they won’t even get outstanding salary payments. “Most work across more than one delivery platform, meaning they have supplementary employment, but this will be scant consolation to those who have lost money as a result of the company folding or those who relied on Deliveroo as their primary source of income,” Taylor said.

Legal cases such as those against Deliveroo and Foodora have broader implications for workers in the sector. Taylor said there is significant international interest in the area from policymakers and academics. “It would seem regulation and/or legislation are incoming to make employment at these firms less precarious. This is certainly something the Transport Workers’ Union (TWU) has been lobbying for some time,” Taylor said.","The company argues that it just doesn’t make enough profit in its Australian subsidiary to continue,” Taylor said.

170,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The 29th Annual National Safety Awards of Excellence, hosted by the NSCA Foundation and GIO Workers Compensation, have recognised Ventia, HSE Global and Monadelphous, among many other businesses and organisations, for their contributions to workplace health and safety. The winners were announced at the National Safety Awards of Excellence Gala Dinner on Thursday, 24 November 2022 at the Palladium at Crown in Melbourne as part of the APOSHO 36 Conference. Any Australian operating business, organisation, alliance or individual in the public or private sector, with a workplace health and safety initiative that complies with one of the nine categories, can be nominated for the awards.

GIO was the major sponsor for the awards, while ecoPortal, Stowe, Fire Safety Australia, Ansell, Actrüa, Moving Mindz and Pro-Visual Publishing were category sponsors. Television presenter Nicky Buckley presided over the awards as the Master of Ceremonies and congratulated the category winners for their contributions to workplace health and safety.

The Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP) took home the prestigious GIO Workers Compensation Award for Excellence in WHS, otherwise known as the Pinnacle Award. The LXRP aims to deliver one of the largest infrastructure projects in Victoria’s history, eliminating 85 level crossings across metropolitan Melbourne and thereby improving safety outcomes for all Victorians. The Safely Work in the Rail Corridor (SWIRC) training was developed to address the LXRP’s increased risk profile due to the new entrants to the rail/construction industry. The course was designed to give new entrants an understanding of the hazards that exist within an operational environment and knowledge of the controls that can be implemented to reduce the risk. Neil Isles, Senior Manager of Safety Programs and Initiatives for the Level Crossing Removal Project, said it was a huge honour to receive the award.

The Department of Transport and Main Roads Queensland was named the NSCA Foundation Member of the Year. The award recognises an NSCA Foundation Individual or Corporate member who demonstrates commitment and leadership in work health and safety. Another notable winner was Ash Presser from URBNSURF, who took home the Ian Chisholm Award for the Best Individual WHS Achievement. To be nominated for this category, the individual must have played a significant role in a recent WHS/OHS initiative and gone above and beyond their normal duties, resulting in a sustainable improvement within an organisation (or area they work or volunteer within). Presser was employed by URBNSURF as an Operations Manager to design, develop and operate a commercial surf park open to the general public; as part of his role, he undertook extensive research to develop risk justification and a six-step validation process to launch a range of health and safety initiatives.

The 30th National Safety Awards of Excellence will take place on 14 September 2023 at The Tivoli in Brisbane. Nominations for the Awards will open on 1 February 2023 and will close on 21 April 2023, with the finalists announced on 5 July 2023.

171,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Dust diseases impact workers from a wide range of industries including construction. Over 300 silicosis cases were diagnosed nationally due to past exposure to respirable crystalline silica at work.*

1 in 4 engineered stone workers who have been in the industry since before 2018 are suffering from silicosis or other silica dust-related diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer, kidney damage and scleroderma. It is expected that this number will rise given workers’ exposure to very high levels of respirable crystalline silica in the engineered stone industry since the early 2000s.**

The newly released Pro-Visual AR Interactive – VIC Construction Site Safety Guide 2022/23 produced in conjunction with Civil Contractors Federation (CCF) and endorsed by the NSCA Foundation aids in recognising and controlling the key hazards with the latest WHS Regulatory Guidelines focused on proactive prevention of injury, ill-health and essential information in order to help create a workplace safety culture of Zero Harm is available via free subscription www.provisual.com.au

Designed to be displayed in the workplace the free (AR) Interactive – VIC Construction Site Safety Guide 2022/23 is developed with interactive augmented reality (AR) capabilities for use with a smart device, by simply downloading the free Pro-Vis AR App via the App Store or Google Play. This leading-edge digitally interactive Guide is a targeted response to a changed landscape as workers often respond well to information relayed via visual means such as videos and 3D visualisations rather than technical written documents.

The rapid re-emergence of accelerated silicosis and changes to the Occupational Health and Safety Amendment (Crystalline Silica) Regulations 2021 is a primary focus of the VIC Construction Site Safety Guide 2022/23 to provide greater protection to Victorian construction employees working with respirable crystalline silica who are at high risk of being exposed to the dust if it is not controlled which outlines Part 4.5 – Crystalline Silica substituted with the Regulations:

Division 1 – Crystalline Silica Hazard Control Statement

Division 2 – Duties of manufacturers and suppliers

Division 3 – Duties of employers and self-employed persons

Division 4 – Licensing requirements inclusive of Health Monitoring and Administrative Controls

An employer or self-employed person is required to hold an engineered stone licence by 15 November 2022 if an engineered stone process is undertaken at the workplace for which they are responsible.

Division 5 – Engineered Stone Licences and summary changes to Part 6.1. Licences

172,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Centre for Work Health and Safety has partnered with digital innovators Talk 5 and Pioneera as part of a new program to explore how app-based interventions can reduce harm in workplaces. The research projects aim to help people overcome language barriers while accessing safety information and preventing employee burnout. Head of SafeWork NSW Natasha Mann said that while there are many variables on worksites across NSW, most workers will have access to some form of technology, whether on a phone, a notebook computer or other device.

“This public–private partnership combines science, technology and evidence in a bid to deliver better outcomes for employees and businesses. The centre is working with these two New South Wales-based businesses to leverage their groundbreaking safety ideas with a focus on practical solutions,” Mann said.

The Talk 5 app allows workers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds to access important safety information in their preferred language. Talk 5’s Managing Director, George Bancs, said the business understands that the NSW workforce is culturally diverse. “Talk 5 recognises bringing working people together from all walks of life requires an unparalleled level of communication. We understand workplace safety depends on people and businesses having quality communication methods that are easy to understand. Talk 5’s service delivers digital multilingual checklists, safety guidance and more via visual, voice and audio technologies,” Bancs said.

The partnership will ensure the Talk 5 app meets standards for culturally diverse employees while identifying ways to enhance the product with an underlying evidence base. The research aims to boost the mental health and wellbeing of working people. The centre is also partnering with Pioneera, to improve support for employees. The company has created an online wellbeing app that employs a mixture of psychology and artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver personalised nudges to workers to catch the precursors to burnout before it appears. Danielle Owen Whitford, founder and CEO of Pioneera, said the use of smart technologies like natural language processing and sentiment analyses can help employers detect and prevent burnout in teams.

“Pioneera aims to create workplaces where both employees and employers have the right insights and tools to be healthier, happier and more productive at work. The Pioneera app features an animated AI assistant that delivers stress management tips, or ‘nudges’, to workers in real time as needed,” Whitford said.

The Director for the Centre for Work Health and Safety, Sky Buatava, said the centre is working with diverse stakeholders to develop solutions to work health and safety problems. “There are so many untapped ideas to solve common WHS issues just sitting in the minds of people who are on the frontline. We want to work with those people to create safer workplaces,” Buatava said.","“This public–private partnership combines science, technology and evidence in a bid to deliver better outcomes for employees and businesses.

173,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A coalition of human rights organisations and academics has called for the federal government to overhaul Australia’s modern slavery laws, after an investigation revealed that, three years into the Modern Slavery Act’s operation, companies are still failing to identify obvious modern slavery risks in their supply chains or take action to address them. The report examines the second year of corporate statements submitted to the government’s Modern Slavery Register; the statements are from 92 companies sourced from four sectors with known risks of modern slavery: garments from China, rubber gloves from Malaysia, seafood from Thailand and fresh produce from Australia.

Professor Justine Nolan, Director of the Australian Human Rights Institute at UNSW Sydney, called for Australian companies to move from ‘paper-driven’ responses to effective action on modern slavery, adding that too many companies are failing to identify obvious risks or are making vague promises that aren’t being fulfilled. “While the Modern Slavery Act has generated increased business awareness of the risks of modern slavery, this hasn’t yet translated into effective practices to remediate and eliminate it. This report reveals an urgency to strengthen the law to require action not just reporting, as well as to equip and resource a regulator to provide greater oversight and enforcement of the Act,” Nolan said.

Freya Dinshaw, Senior Lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said the research indicates the Modern Slavey Act is failing workers, with “little evidence” that the Act is driving meaningful action by companies to lift conditions for supply chain workers at high risk of exploitation. “While the Act has generated a lot of corporate reporting, when you drill down, many of the statements still lack basic required information or make vague commitments which are never fulfilled,” Dinshaw said.

The report found that 66% of companies reviewed are still failing to comply with the basic reporting requirements mandated by the legislation, with some companies not submitting reports at all. Over half of the commitments made by companies in the first year of reporting to improve their modern slavery response (56%) remain unfulfilled based on their second-year statements. The report also revealed that 43% of companies are still failing to identify obvious modern slavery risks in their supply chains. There was also only a 6% increase in the number of companies appearing to be taking some form of effective action to address modern slavery risks, with two in three companies still failing to act.

The Broken Promises report is the follow-up to an earlier report on the first year of corporate reporting, with reached similar conclusions. The Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) is currently under a three-year statutory review due to report in March 2023. Amy Sinclair, Regional Representative for Australia, New Zealand & Pacific, Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, said the Act has failed to instigate a ‘race to the top’ by companies wanting to confront modern slavery, with companies averaging a 7% rate of improvement in two years.

“These results should be viewed against a backdrop of growing inequality and exploitation of workers as the cost-of-living crisis bites ever harder. Our research has revealed the Act to be an incomplete and inadequate strategy for confronting exploitation and addressing the egregious human rights abuse of modern slavery. To best do this, Australia requires a more robust law requiring decisive action by companies and penalties for those who fail to take it,” Sinclair said.

The coalition of human rights organisations and academics has called on the government to strengthen the legislation by requiring companies to undertake due diligence to prevent and address modern slavery in their operations and supply chains; introducing penalties for companies that fail to comply with the Act; and ensuring appropriate oversight and enforcement of the Act by appointing an Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner.

Dinshaw said Australia’s modern slavery laws need to evolve so that they put people, rather than paper, at their centre.

“In order to be more effective, the Act should be amended to require companies to take action to address modern slavery risks rather than just reporting on their current practices. It should impose penalties on companies that fail to do so and have robust oversight and enforcement by an independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner. We urge the government to use the current statutory review to make these key reforms to strengthen the law,” Dinshaw said.","“While the Modern Slavery Act has generated increased business awareness of the risks of modern slavery, this hasn’t yet translated into effective practices to remediate and eliminate it.

174,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"If nothing is done to improve the health of Australia’s male truck drivers, approximately 6067 lives and AU$2.6 billion in productivity could be lost over the next 10 years, according to research from Monash University. Inaction could also cost an estimated $485 million in healthcare costs and 21,173 lost years of life due to work-related disease or injury in the truck driving industry.

Published in The Journal of Occupational Rehabilitation, the study found that while the transport and logistics industry contributed significantly to the Australian economy, few studies had explored the economic and clinical burden attributed to poor truck driver health. In 2020, the industry (which contributed an estimated 7.4% or AU$122.3 billion of gross domestic product to Australia’s economy in 2015–16) employed about 380,000 workers. Researchers estimated that the work-related mortality burden among truck drivers, using modelling to simulate the Australian male working-age population (aged 15–65) from 2021–2030.

The approach employed is reportedly the first to explore the economic implications of the current state of driver health and wellbeing. Researchers used data from the Driving Health study and other published sources to estimate work-related mortality and associated productivity loss and hospital and medication costs. All outcomes were discounted by 5% per annum. Modelling showed that reducing the health burden by 2% could result in savings of AU$10 million in healthcare costs and AU$53 million in lost productivity. The researchers found that despite the importance of the transport and logistics industry to the Australian economy, workers are at a greater risk of work-related injury or disease relative to other industries. “Our analyses highlight the health and economic consequences of poor driver health over the forthcoming decade, and highlight the need for interventions to reduce the burden of work-related injury or disease for truck drivers and other transport workers,” said the researchers.

Program Lead Associate Professor Ross Iles said Driving Health had earlier found that the health and wellbeing of truck drivers in general was poor, and a system-wide effort was needed from the transport industry to help drivers be healthy and stay at work. “What this part of the project adds is a clear economic argument for supporting driver health and wellbeing. If the current state continues, there will be an enormous cost, not only for the individuals concerned, but also for the Australian economy. The Driving Health project found there is no easy fix, but this analysis shows that even a small improvement in driver health will lead to savings of tens of millions of dollars,” said Iles.

According to earlier research, transport and logistics workers have worse health outcomes than those in other industries, especially musculoskeletal and trauma-related injuries. They also have a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, obesity and hypertension, which has been attributed to long working hours, poor access to health care, exposure to physical and mental stress and other behaviours and occupational characteristics which contribute to poor health. The new research revealed that a collective national effort is required to improve the health and wellbeing of Australian truck drivers to reduce the burden of work-related injury or disease for truck drivers and other transport workers.

The researchers also found that there are limited studies exploring the long-term economic burden attributed to poor health among transport workers, and a clear economic argument for improving driver health could provide a compelling case for a collective effort across the industry. Study co-author Dr Caryn Van Vreden said there were some efforts underway but they were hampered by lack of funding and policy change from the government. “Despite efforts to improve driver health by the industry, greater input from government and regulators is needed. This includes increases in funding and changes in policy to effect lasting change,” Van Vreden said.","Researchers estimated that the work-related mortality burden among truck drivers, using modelling to simulate the Australian male working-age population (aged 15–65) from 2021–2030.

175,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"SafeWork SA has warned builders and contractors to prioritise safety over busy workloads as they scramble to complete projects before the looming Christmas shutdown. The warning follows two notifiable dangerous incidents in the past few weeks where single prop formwork systems have collapsed during a concrete pour. Two building industry apprentices also received electric shocks in separate incidents in October after safe clearance distances to overhead powerlines were not maintained.

There were 39 notifiable construction industry incidents reported to SafeWork SA between 1 October and 14 November, primarily electric shocks, falls from ladders and lacerations to hands caused by tools including nail guns. The 39 incidents represent a 20% increase in near misses and serious injuries compared with the average weekly incident rate for the first nine months of 2021. They also led to 12 workers being hospitalised.

The building industry traditionally closes for about three weeks from just before Christmas until mid-January, with construction businesses scrambling to reduce backlogs and finish projects before the break. SafeWork SA Executive Director Martyn Campbell said safety at work affects workers, their families, businesses and the wider community. “Heavy workloads and tight timelines are no excuse for corner cutting, especially when it impacts safety. Everyone enjoys the chance to take some time off over Christmas so it is vital that we stay safe in the busy weeks before the break,” Campbell said.

The construction industry accounts for approximately 16% of worker fatalities nationally. Figures released by Safe Work Australia in November showed that there were 24 construction industry deaths in 2021, down from 36 in 2020. Construction — together with transport and agriculture — was identified as among three ‘priority industries’ in Safe Work Australia’s latest Work-related traumatic injury fatalities Australia report. The residential construction industry in South Australia has been booming as a result of building approvals increasing in 2021. However, supply shortages for materials such as structural timber during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays to many projects, placing pressure on construction businesses.

South Australia Construction Safety Alliance chair Lex Hanegraaf said the lead-up to Christmas causes additional challenges, along with statistically high rates of incidents. “The lead-up to the festive period presents various pressures at work, and the break can be a particularly difficult time for some due to other social reasons. Please take the time to look after yourself, and also keep an eye out for other people around you,” Hanegraaf said.

Construction workers are reportedly six times more likely to die from suicide than an accident at work and young construction workers are three times more likely to die from suicide than other young Australians. MATES in Construction aims to support the mental health of workers in the construction and allied industries in South Australia. MATES in Construction Case Manager Patrick Kukla said November was a stressful time for the industry as pressure mounted to complete projects. “We see long work hours, tight deadlines, difficult budgets and work-life balance gets pushed aside. The common reaction is to feel cornered, pressured, stressed, tired and feeling like a bit of a passenger in your own life,” Kukla said.

MATES in Construction ran a campaign in November with tips to help workers manage stress through the busy period. The tips were designed to help construction workers take time out to think about options and avoid actions that might cause them further stress. MATES in Construction also has a free 24/7 helpline that gives stressed workers the opportunity to speak about their issues and improve mental health.","There were 39 notifiable construction industry incidents reported to SafeWork SA between 1 October and 14 November, primarily electric shocks, falls from ladders and lacerations to hands caused by tools including nail guns.

176,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Australia’s gender pay gap could narrow by a third if more balanced gender concentration was achieved across all industries and occupations, according to the seventh edition of the ‘BCEC|WGEA Gender Equity Insights 2022 Report’. Published by the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre (BCEC) and the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) and drawing on new WGEA data, the report finds that Australia’s gender pay gap would fall from an estimated 23.3% to 15.6% if a 40:40:20 gender concentration — 40% women, 40% men and 20% any gender — was achieved across all industries and occupations.

The report uses the new WGEA location data to compare pay metrics, gender pay gaps and organisational practices across Australia’s states and territories as well as regional areas. The analysis reveals the extent to which the overall gender pay gap is driven by higher concentrations of men in high salary industries and jobs, and higher shares of women working in lower salary sectors.

The report found that for Western Australia — the state with the nation’s highest gender pay gap — the gap in total remuneration would halve from 32.1% to 16.5% if a 40:40:20 gender balance was achieved across all industries. In the Northern Territory, the gender pay gap would reduce by two-thirds, while New South Wales and Victoria would see gender pay gaps fall by 7.4 and 6.5 percentage points respectively. Queensland recorded a larger margin of 8.8 percentage points.

Report author and BCEC Director Alan Duncan said the report provides a better understanding of how the different concentrations of women and men working in individual states and across industry sectors affects the overall gender pay gap. The report also identifies ways to address it. According to Duncan, to achieve a 40:40:20 gender concentration for industries in Australia, gender balance needs to be addressed in both directions, by increasing the share of women working in male-dominated occupations and industries, and increasing the share of men in female-dominated professions.

“We need to see an increase in the share of women in leadership positions from CEO through to executive manager, in roles in the professional, scientific, technical and trades sectors, and a rise in the share of men working in health, community and social services. We also need to reflect on whether the salaries paid to healthcare, social assistance and community sector workers adequately reflect the true value of their contribution to society,” Duncan said.

According to Duncan, WA had the largest gender pay gap for total remuneration, while Tasmania had the lowest (10.4%), with the pay gap wider in states where more men were employed in higher paying jobs in the highest-paying industries, such as mining and construction. Women also made up a lesser percentage of the workforce for key industries in those states, including only 16% of the construction sector workforce in WA, compared to 31% in Victoria and 27% in NSW. However, women made up 80% of the workforce in the healthcare and social assistance sector, and two-thirds of workers in the education and training sector. The evidence indicates that women don’t have the same opportunities to earn higher wages as their male colleagues.

WGEA Director Mary Wooldridge said that visibility into the location and age data of employees provided a rich new data source for a deeper analysis of, and insights into, the drivers of the gender pay gap across the country. Wooldridge added that without clear and actionable gender strategies and targets for improvement, progress on gender equality will stall. “Employers who reimagine traditionally gendered roles are reaping the benefits of larger and more diverse recruitment pools, improvements in productivity and profitability and reductions in the gender pay gap. Further, Australia has one of the most highly gender-segregated industrial structures in the developed world. We need to actively challenge gender stereotypes, including those that start informing our children from an early age, to realise improved gender balance across industries and occupations,” Wooldridge said.

The report found that the gender pay gap was higher in remote areas compared to major cities, with men being paid nearly $17,800 more than women in very remote locations. The report also explores how age affects pay and found that the gender pay gap widens for all women as they get older, but that the age of divergence in pay between women and men varies depending on the sector in which they work. Co-author Dr Silvia Salazar said it is concerning that women are also impacted depending on what industry they work in, the region where they work and what age they are, compared to men.

“The data shows that gender pay gaps increased for older-age female workers, as well as for women working in remote and very remote areas across Australia. These findings raise some important questions about the value that businesses put on the work and contributions of women in older age cohorts compared to men at the same age. It also highlights the impact of the gender inequalities for salary caused by the challenges that women face in accessing the same higher-paying roles in the same industry sectors as men. It is inevitable that gender pay gaps will persist if more women continue to work in lower-paid industry sectors and jobs, and men are employed in higher concentrations in sectors that pay high salaries,” Salazar said.

Duncan said that the report invited solutions to break down barriers faced by women in the Australian workforce, adding that businesses play a key role in fixing this problem.

“Gender composition differences across different industries and sectors is not a justifiable explanation for high gender pay gaps. Instead, this report shines a spotlight on the impact of gender inequalities in terms of pay and most importantly the challenges women face in accessing the same higher-paying roles in the same industries as men,” Duncan said.

According to Duncan, businesses can level the playing field for women within their organisations or for those looking to join the workforce by ensuring effective policies and practices related to recruitment, retention and promotion are in place to promote gender equality opportunities for women across all industries. “These include a positive attitude towards flexible work, support for people with family and care responsibilities, specific targeted policies to eradicate sexual harassment and promote greater respect at work, and support measures to assist people experiencing family and domestic violence,” Duncan said.","The report uses the new WGEA location data to compare pay metrics, gender pay gaps and organisational practices across Australia’s states and territories as well as regional areas.

177,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Research from the University of Bristol and the University of Oxford has found that workers in the gig economy feel “under threat” from review websites, with most workers in fear of online reviews sacrificing their future income. The study analysed the reputation systems of some of the biggest gig economy platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr, which use customer feedback to produce ratings. It found the algorithms — processes used to rank workers according to performance metrics — lack transparency and are highly volatile, leaving workers vulnerable to capricious and malicious workers.

Findings revealed that seven in 10 gig economy freelancers working remotely from across the world for some of the biggest online platforms, providing services ranging from data entry to website design, were worried about clients providing unfair feedback and negatively affecting their future earnings. Lead author Dr Alex Wood at the University of Bristol Business School said it was “shocking” how workers expressed continuous worry about the potential consequences of receiving a single bad rating from an unfair or malevolent client, and how this could leave them unable to continue making a living.

The situation is creating a trend of ‘reputational insecurity’ in the workforce, where self-employed contract workers are experiencing greater instability and concern about future access to work. Unlike traditional references and personal recommendations, gig economy platforms rely on algorithmic systems that score and rank workers according to customer-generated online ratings. Special categories, such as “Rising star” and “Top rated”, are created to allegedly denote high-quality and trustworthy workers. But the study found the algorithms are opaque and unstable, leaving workers anxious about how they will be rated by potentially malicious customer ratings.

The fleeting nature of reviews also means some workers have resorted to putting in extra hours unpaid or even doing entire jobs for free, to avoid negative reviews. This finding emerged from qualitative interviews carried out by the researchers in international cities, including London, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Manila. The researchers analysed surveys of nearly 900 gig workers from the UK and Europe and found that 67% of the 436 UK workers agreed ‘reputational insecurity’ is widespread, while 62% of the 430 from Europe felt this was true.

“We discovered some workers continued to make free revisions for clients to help ensure their satisfaction and favourable feedback. Others cancelled the contract and provided their work for free if they felt the customer was unhappy and might leave a harmful rating,” Wood said.

The study, published in Sociology, found the companies operated without checks and balances to verify the ratings, and effective processes to seek redress and corrections were also lacking. Study co-author Vili Lehdonvirta from the University of Oxford said that the study is important, as platform rating and reputation systems become increasingly ubiquitous beyond the gig economy. “Therefore, countering these processes of reputational insecurity will not only be an important policy endeavour for improving gig work but also the wider platform economy,” Lehdonvirta said.

The national Understanding Society survey indicated there are approximately 600,000 gig economy workers in the UK who have used a website, platform or app to make money and around a third are online remote workers.","The study analysed the reputation systems of some of the biggest gig economy platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr, which use customer feedback to produce ratings.

179,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"During National Asbestos Awareness Month (1–30 November), the Asbestos Education Committee aims to increase awareness of the danger of asbestos when renovating or maintaining homes, particularly amid the continued building and renovation boom and the tradie shortage. Amid the growing popularity of renovating, with homeowners gripped by interest rate hikes and the rising costs of labour, concerns are growing that homeowners are taking avoidable risks with asbestos and jeopardising their health and the health of others when carrying out DIY renovations.

Over 4000 Australians reportedly die each year from asbestos-related diseases — around 265% more than the annual national road toll. As a result, it is vital that homeowners, renovators and tradies heed the warnings and respect the dangers of asbestos. Clare Collins, Chair of the Asbestos Education Committee and director of the national campaign, said that Asbestos Awareness Month aims to reduce the incidences of avoidable asbestos exposure to prevent asbestos-related diseases by providing Australians with essential information to help save lives.

“While asbestos-containing materials remain in one-third of Australian homes, the significance of this dedicated month-long campaign to the ongoing health of Australians cannot be overstated. And with health experts predicting a continued rise in third-wave asbestos-related diseases as a result of exposure to asbestos fibres when renovating or maintaining old properties, the Australian Mesothelioma Registry data on exposure, the growing popularity of renovating and the current shortage of tradespersons, homeowners must learn to respect the serious risks posed by asbestos mismanagement to protect their health and the health of their loved ones,” Collins said.

Cherie Barber, Ambassador for the National Asbestos Awareness campaign, said that many homeowners wrongly believe that asbestos-containing products are only found in fibro homes made from asbestos-cement sheeting. However, Barber said that asbestos was used extensively in the manufacture of more than 3000 building and decorator products that can still be found in brick, fibro, weatherboard, clad homes, apartments or sheds built or renovated before 1990. “Many of these products could be lurking under floor coverings including carpets, linoleum and vinyl tiles; behind wall and floor tiles; in cement floors, internal and external walls, ceilings and ceiling space (insulation), eaves, roofs; around hot water pipes, fences, home extensions, garages, outdoor toilets, backyard and farm structures, chook sheds and even dog kennels. It was used everywhere!” Barber said.

If undisturbed, well maintained and in a stable, sealed condition, these products are unlikely to pose health risks. However, if disturbed during maintenance, renovation or demolition, with invisible fibres released that can be inhaled, this can lead to asbestos-related diseases including malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer, asbestosis and benign pleural disease. There is no cure for mesothelioma, a cancer that can develop between 33 and 44 years after inhaling asbestos fibres with the average survival time following diagnosis just 12 months. With growing evidence suggesting the current occurrences of asbestos-related diseases are as a result of exposure to asbestos fibres during DIY and renovations, and with more people diagnosed as a result of inhaling fibres in non-occupational settings, every homeowner, renovator and tradie must respect asbestos and learn how to identify asbestos-containing products to manage and dispose of them safely in line with regulations.

“With the popularity of renovating continuing to rise coupled with the current tradie shortage, we want to ensure people renovate safely. We don’t want people to take the ‘she’ll be right’ approach and start ripping out old floor coverings, wall and floor tiles or undertaking any work or demolition without first checking to see if asbestos might be lurking in their home. Complacency poses the greatest risk of all so it is vital people learn to respect asbestos as a real and present danger and learn how to manage it safely by visiting Australia’s most comprehensive, trusted source of asbestos information,” Barber said.

The Asbestos Awareness website offers extensive information, including the types of homes that may be affected and the types of products to look for. The online Asbestos Product Database provides images and locations of products likely to contain asbestos and the Asbestos Awareness – 20 Point Safety Check gives information on the risks and how to manage asbestos safely. Additionally, the Fact Sheets for Homeowners provide instructions on how to stay safe around asbestos, while the Asbestos Awareness Residential Property Checklist – A Homeowner’s Guide to Identifying Asbestos-Containing Materials is a useful step-by-step guide that takes homeowners through their property to help them identify where asbestos might be lurking and acts as an asbestos register of suspected asbestos locations for the ongoing safe management of asbestos-containing materials not removed during renovations.

“The rule is, if your home was built or renovated prior to 1990 and you suspect it contains asbestos, before taking up tools be sure to engage a licensed asbestos assessor or occupational hygienist to inspect your property. And if you need to remove asbestos, only use licensed asbestos removalists because it’s not worth the risk. When it comes to asbestos, renovators should expect the unexpected! If you find asbestos in your home, don’t cut it! Don’t drill it! Don’t sand it! Don’t saw it! Don’t scrape it! Don’t scrub it! Don’t dismantle it! Don’t tip it! Don’t waterblast it! And whatever you do, don’t dump it!” Barber said.

Now in its 11th year, the award-winning national Asbestos Awareness campaign will continue to warm homeowners, renovators and tradies of the dangers of asbestos and direct them to comprehensive, trusted asbestos information, to help save lives.","As a result, it is vital that homeowners, renovators and tradies heed the warnings and respect the dangers of asbestos.

180,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Life is getting even tougher for workers on the frontline of many essential industries, with 64% of workers saying the challenges and pressure they face at work have increased in the last 12 months, according to a report released by SafetyCulture. Nearly a third of those surveyed said they are under ‘immense pressure’ at work, while 73% of respondents said they feel they have been under increased pressure at home during the last 12 months. The Feedback from the Field report represents the views of Australian, British and American ‘frontline workers’ — individuals who must “physically show up to their job”, including the likes of hospitality, retail, manufacturing, healthcare and logistics workers. More than half of this frontline workforce (54%) said if they had the opportunity, they would leave frontline work altogether.

The report revealed that Australian frontline workers are facing unnecessary pressure due to funding their own safety, avoidable workplace injuries and bad processes, technology and tools. According to the report, 58% of Australian frontline workers had to spend their own money to stay safe at work during the last 12 months. Australian frontline workers spent an estimated AU$3.67 billion on this in the last 12 months (an average of AU$928 per worker).

Meanwhile, one in three (33%) Australian frontline workers said they have experienced workplace injury due to inadequate processes or communication, while 41% know a colleague who has. Nearly half (47%) of Australian workers said they’d like to see greater investment by their employer in technology to improve processes, efficiency and safety, while 41% said they don’t have a say in the technology and tools they use at work.

Sam Byrnes, General Manager (ANZ) of SafetyCulture, said that frontline workers are under increasing pressure when it comes to doing their everyday jobs, despite it being more than two years since the start of the pandemic. “Life should be getting easier for our frontline workers and yet we’re seeing a growing expectation for them to do more, with less, and putting themselves at risk. The good news for businesses is that it’s not too late to address these issues and prevent more exits. Small investments in technology can do more than just help businesses keep pace — organisations can start taking steps today to become more efficient and help alleviate the load,” Byrnes said.

To ease the pressure on the frontline, SafetyCulture advises employers to remove technological red tape by digitising ways of working. This can be done by shifting from paper checks to digital inspections, or by automating manual tasks with the help of sensors and IoT, thereby leveraging technology to free up capacity. The quickest and most accessible way to get training out to those in the field or working remotely is reportedly through leveraging mobile learning; according to SafetyCulture, this can ease the mental load and build team resilience. Conducting an audit of processes is also valuable, with employers encouraged to collate and integrate their data sources in a meaningful way; this can turn data into useful information, which then enables employers to react in real time and prevent incidents before they happen.

Businesses have a key role in addressing the issues that are making work more challenging for frontline workers. It’s more pressing than ever to understand the pressure points faced by the workforce. “We hope this report will help businesses and employers of all kinds to engage with the reality of working on the frontlines. If employers can better engage with their frontline workers, they can focus on giving them the right tools and support they need to do their best work, every single day,” Byrnes said.","More than half of this frontline workforce (54%) said if they had the opportunity, they would leave frontline work altogether.

181,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Almost half of the Australian workforce (46%) say their work is suffering as a result of poor mental health, according to the ADP Research Institute’s People at Work 2022: A Global Workforce View survey. The survey of almost 1400 workers in Australia found that 56% of millennial workers (25- to 34-year-olds), compared to 17% of the 55+ age bracket, are also suffering as a result of poor mental health. The survey also revealed that people working from home are more likely to feel that poor mental health is having a detrimental impact on their work (55%) than their colleagues in the workplace (36%). Across the Asia–Pacific region, 56% of workers said mental health issues are taking a toll on their work.

Other recently published studies indicate that alongside the uncertainty and disruption caused by lockdowns, the COVID-19 infection itself can increase the risk of mental health problems developing, and as a result, mental health services have been inundated in many countries. In addition, the frequent stress and burnout that many workers were already feeling appears to have been exacerbated since the pandemic, with 70% of workers across Australia saying they experience stress at work at least once a week, up from 62% pre-pandemic in 2020, while 27% feel stressed four or more times a week.

The most common cause of stress is having increased responsibility as a result of the pandemic, with 45% of workers citing it as a major cause. Other sources of stress include the length of the working day (29%), problems with technology (27%) and concerns over job security (27%). Kylie Baullo, Managing Director ANZ of ADP, said that there are ongoing issues around the rising cost of living worldwide, with the demands placed on workers across industries only rising. Baullo noted that there are, however, a range of issues and factors which can lead to mental ill health. “It’s concerning to see the number of workers, and especially millennial workers, struggling in Australia due to mental health issues. It is important to note that workers may be struggling whether they are working from home or at the office — in this case, managers should be vigilant to ensure they are offering support no matter the working location,” Baullo said.

Most Australian employers (82%) are being proactive about finding new ways to support the mental health of their workforce. The initiatives tried include checking in or communicating with employees (33% of workers say their employers are doing so), allowing wellbeing days off (27%), implementing Employee Assistance Programs (23%) and allowing staff to take additional breaks during the day (21%). Baullo said that unless the causes of poor mental health — whether they be personal or work-related — are identified and addressed, the impact of well-intentioned schemes could be undermined. “Employers need to prioritise ways to boost workplace mental wellbeing, and remember that there is no one-size-fits-all approach,” Baullo said.","Across the Asia–Pacific region, 56% of workers said mental health issues are taking a toll on their work.

182,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Australia’s economy would reportedly be $28.6 billion larger each year and 185,000 additional full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs would be created in the absence of work-related injuries and illnesses, according to new research published by Safe Work Australia. The research, carried out by Deloitte Access Economics, explored the cost of work-related injury and illness in Australia and estimated how much value could be created within the Australian economy by removing work-related injury and illness. The research used an innovative modelling approach and showed that workers across all occupations and skill levels would also benefit from a wage rise of 1.3% on average each year, in the absence of work-related injuries and illnesses.

Safe Work Australia Branch Manager (Evidence, Communication and Strategic Policy) Meredith Bryant said the findings illustrate the economic and productivity benefits of investing in work health and safety for the wider community. “Creating workplaces that are safe and free of injury and illness provides broad economic benefits for all Australians, including more jobs and better pay,” Bryant said.

Bryant said that the report provides an important evidence base for policymakers and economists to better understand why work health and safety is so important, embedding a shift from ‘how’ to do safety to ‘why’ we do safety. “The report gives Safe Work Australia and others involved in work health and safety a different lens through which to examine and quantify the impacts of work-related injury and illness. We will use the findings to drive progress in work health and safety thinking and emphasise the need to devote attention and resources to harm prevention,” Bryant said.

According to the report, there were 6.9 million work-related injuries and illnesses in Australia between 2008–2018, costing $37.6 billion in health system costs and causing a 2.2 million FTE productivity loss. The research, which utilises computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling, is reportedly the first of its kind to adopt the World Health Organisation’s guidelines to identifying the economic consequences of disease and injury. “We know that the devastating effects of injury and illness at work go beyond the effect on the individual, their workplace, occupation, industry or jurisdiction in which they occur. Our communities and the Australian economy more broadly feel the impacts of these injuries and illnesses including through costs associated with loss of productivity, reduced work participation and increased health care,” Bryant said.

The report has been published on Safe Work Australia’s website during National Safe Work Month, which focuses on creating safe and healthy work for all.","The research, carried out by Deloitte Access Economics, explored the cost of work-related injury and illness in Australia and estimated how much value could be created within the Australian economy by removing work-related injury and illness.

183,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A shift in thinking is needed across Australian workplaces to better recognise the impacts of domestic and family violence (DFV) in the workplace, according to a study released by Monash University. The report by Dr Emma McNicol, Professor Kate Fitz-Gibbon and Sally Brewer found that there is a need for all Australian industries and workplaces to develop and introduce workplace support systems to mitigate the impacts of victimisation on work participation, and better support employees experiencing domestic violence. DFV is increasingly recognised as a national crisis, with one in three women reportedly having experienced physical violence since the age of 15 and one in five women having experienced sexual violence.

The report significantly advances Australia’s evidence base on how best to understand and respond to DFV within the workplace. The study, based on an anonymous survey of 3000 victim-survivors working across a range of industries in Australia, has examined how their experiences of DFV impacted their employment and the workplace response they received, if any. The report’s lead author, McNicol, said that the report findings further evidence the myriad ways in which DFV impacts the working lives of victim-survivors. “The results show that DFV impacts victim-survivors’ immediate participation in current employment while also impacting future employment prospects,” McNicol said.

Of the 3000 participants, 2515 victim-survivors reported that their job was impacted by their experience of DFV. According to the study, one in two victim-survivors reported that DFV negatively impacted their career progression and opportunities, while two in three victim-survivors felt that DFV impacted their ability to concentrate at work. Two in five victim-survivors reported that DFV impacted their productivity and ability to enjoy their job, and one in three victim-survivors reported that DFV led them to socially withdraw from co-workers. One in four victim-survivors also reported that DFV impacted their punctuality for work.

Fitz-Gibbon said these results reveal the impacts of DFV on an individual’s capacity to fulfil the expectations of their role. “Understanding the link between DFV and reduced work performance is essential to inform workplace support practice and policies, ensuring that victim-survivors are not subjected to performance management or at risk of demotion or employment termination,” Fitz-Gibbon said.

For victim-survivors, deciding whether or not to disclose their experience to members of their workplace is a significant decision, with only 30% of survey respondents having told someone at work about their experience of DFV. This is striking, given that the majority of respondents reported that DFV impacted their work. Nicol said that victim-survivors who did disclose their experiences of DFV at work were more likely to share with a close colleague as opposed to a manager or HR representative. “This finding reinforces the need for comprehensive education and training on responding to DFV at all levels of the workplace,” Nicol said.

The study found that nearly 50% of respondents had experienced workplace interference strategies by their abusers. Interference strategies can include making it difficult for a victim-survivor to get to work, phoning them repeatedly at work, arriving at their workplace unexpectedly or harassing colleagues at their workplace. “Our study reveals that impeding access to employment is a key tactic utilised by perpetrators. Abusers not only make it difficult for victim-survivors to engage in paid employment, but also tactically impede victim-survivors’ abilities to perform, advance career goals and to thrive at work,” Fitz-Gibbon said.

The study also found that one in five victim-survivors worked in the same workplace as their abuser, and three in five victim-survivors who worked alongside their abuser reported that the abuser held a position of power above them in the workplace. Nicol said that these findings have important implications for employee safety, duty of care and the provision of workplace supports for victim-survivors nationally.

The study recommends that every Australian workplace prioritise the implementation of a DFV workplace policy. It also urges Australian workplaces to prioritise the cultivation of a compassionate workplace culture that is DFV-informed. “It is essential that all Australian employees, regardless of their level and management responsibilities, are equipped to respond in a way that ensures the victim-survivor feels believed and validated, and also with an understanding of the support pathways specific to their workplace,” Fitz-Gibbon said.","The report’s lead author, McNicol, said that the report findings further evidence the myriad ways in which DFV impacts the working lives of victim-survivors.

184,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Queensland Mining & Energy Union has condemned a coalmining company’s attempts to import foreign labour. Sojitz Blue applied to import coalmine workers from overseas while simultaneously offering current workers substandard work contracts and delaying negotiations for an enterprise agreement. The company operates the Gregory Crinum and Meteor Down South (MDS) coalmines near Emerald in Queensland and employs 350 workers. The company informed the Union that it is seeking a Company Specific Labour Agreement from the Department of Home Affairs to recruit foreign production operators for its Gregory Crinum mine. The company aims to recruit production operators for excavators, trucks, loaders, graders, water carts and diggers.

MEU Queensland District President Steve Smyth said that the company put its workers on individual contracts, thereby withholding a range of industry-standard pay and conditions including retention payments, sick leave provisions and redundancy entitlements.

“If this outfit sat down and negotiated a fair enterprise agreement at market rate with Australian workers they wouldn’t be in this pickle. That’s all money Sojitz Blue is trousering instead of their workers, and they wonder why people take their skills elsewhere. If Sojitz Blue think they can import cheap labour from overseas to undercut Australian workers, they need to know our members will fight them every step of the way. Most decent Australians would be appalled that a company, during a coal boom where prices have gone from $90 to $400 a tonne, could undercut good regional jobs by choppering in foreign workers,” Smyth said.

According to Smyth, the Australian coal industry is forecast to turn over $100 billion in revenue this year, marking an increase of $50 billion from last year. “Our members at Sojitz Blue complain all the time they have no career development so if they want to increase their skills and move from driving trucks to operating loaders, graders or diggers they are just blocked by the company; that’s incredibly bad for individual morale. We only know Sojitz Blue is trying to fly in cheap labour because they are required to tell us by law, otherwise they would already have them onsite undercutting Australian jobs,” Smyth said.

Most mining companies employ staff on an Enterprise Agreement rather than individual contracts. Enterprise Agreements are approved by the Fair Work Commission to ensure workers are no worse off than on the Black Coal Industry Award and negotiated to industry standards. Many workers at Sojitz Blue reportedly have lesser conditions than the rest of the industry, as they are on individual contracts.","Sojitz Blue applied to import coalmine workers from overseas while simultaneously offering current workers substandard work contracts and delaying negotiations for an enterprise agreement.

One of the most common causes of foodborne illness is the storage and display of potentially hazardous foods at inadequate temperatures for extended periods. This can lead to the rapid and sustained growth of food poisoning bacteria. Potentially hazardous foods should be kept at 5 °C or colder or above 60 °C wherever possible, however ready-to-eat foods can safely remain between 5 and 60°C for up to 4 hours.

Standard 3.2.2 Food Safety Practices and General Requirements is also a focus of the Club Managers Guide to Workplace Safety 2023 which sets out specific requirements for keeping potentially hazardous food at specified temperatures and for cooling and reheating. It is important that food purchased, supplied and provided by the Club complies with proper food hygiene standards to ensure the safety and health of both providers and consumers.

This guidance material has been prepared to also complement the relevant state regulations and council requirements for food hygiene. Clubs must comply with these requirements unless they can show that they have a safe alternative system in place to ensure that food stays safe to eat.

186,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"WorkSafe Victoria has urged those in flood-affected areas to be alert for unexpected hazards in the workplace and to fully assess the risks involved when commencing any clean-up activities. Contaminated water, broken glass and debris, damaged electricity supplies and asbestos are among the risks to health and safety facing those returning to flooded worksites. Employers must ensure that work is properly planned and coordinated with regular communication, sufficient training and supervision for workers and volunteers, and regular rest breaks to manage fatigue.

When cleaning up after a flood, workers must be equipped with appropriate protective clothing, such as sturdy, waterproof boots, heavy-duty gloves and eyewear. Common hazards include sewage containing harmful bacteria that may have overflowed inside a building; wet, slippery and unstable surfaces; and wild animals including rodents, snakes and spiders.

WorkSafe Victoria Executive Director of Health and Safety Narelle Beer urged duty holders to follow any recommendation by emergency services before entering flood-affected sites. Dr Beer said that workplaces inundated with contaminated floodwater must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and stressed the importance of personal hygiene. “Only use water that has been boiled or disinfected to wash your hands. Wear protective clothing to avoid cuts from glass and other sharp objects that may be floating in contaminated water,” Beer said.

Damaged gas and electricity appliances must be avoided until declared safe by an electrician or plumber. Beer advises employers and workers to use battery-operated torches instead of candles, as open flames could be dangerous if gas has collected inside a building. Employers are also urged to take the necessary steps if a damaged workplace contains asbestos. “If your workplace contains asbestos building materials, licensed asbestos contractors should be employed to undertake any repair and renovation,” Beer said.

Before starting any clean-up and recovery task, employers should take time to identify potential hazards and consider how to remove or control the associated risks. All work should be properly planned and coordinated with regular communication, sufficient supervision and regular rest breaks. Employers are advised to only use equipment that is in good condition, fit for purpose and has appropriate guards in place. Appropriate personal protective equipment should also be provided for each task (such as boots, gloves, eye and ear protection, hats, sun protective clothing and high-visibility vests).

Employers should ensure that all machinery and vehicle operators are competent and experienced in using specific equipment for the intended task. Employers must also clear debris from areas where vehicles are operating, implement traffic management plans and be aware of unstable ground and potential washouts hidden by standing water. Powered machinery should be used for lifting large or heavy items, particularly if they are waterlogged. WorkSafe Victoria also encourages employers to identify any likely asbestos-containing materials or dangerous chemicals, and to ensure that children are well supervised and away from areas where work is going on.","When cleaning up after a flood, workers must be equipped with appropriate protective clothing, such as sturdy, waterproof boots, heavy-duty gloves and eyewear.

187,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A new facility at RMIT University will be testing emergency services’ uniforms to help ensure the safety of the personal protective clothing created for firefighters and defence personnel. Called the Flash-Fire Laboratory for Advanced Manikin & Material Evaluation (FLAMME), the $2.3 million modular flame test chamber will be used by RMIT researchers and research students in partnership with industry. The insulated steel chamber inside textile research facilities at RMIT’s Brunswick campus is roughly the size of a shipping container; at the centrepiece of the chamber is a fire-proof mannequin who can withstand the full force of 12 super-power jet flames without getting burnt. Outside the chamber is an operating room with a large viewing window, so users can watch combustion tests in progress. The chamber is designed to be used for textiles, but researchers also aim to test the flammability of building and automotive materials.

Professor Rajiv Padhye, the Director of the Centre for Materials Innovation and Future Fashion at RMIT, said there is a high demand for such a facility to test uniforms. “We could test the fire resistance of uniforms for firefighters, as well as soldiers, gas platform workers and steel foundry workers,” Padhye said.

RMIT Associate Deputy Vice Chancellor (Learning and Teaching) Professor Robyn Healy said the industry currently ships items to Canada for testing, which can lead to long waits to get the results. “This new facility will allow manufacturers both locally and from across the Asia–Pacific to actually be there during the testing and make adjustments to the testing protocols where needed,” Healy said.

With Australia about to enter another fire season, Healy said it is crucial to ensure that firefighters and volunteers have the highest quality uniforms to protect them. “Firefighters are constantly putting themselves in danger to protect the community. This combustion chamber will help develop and test textiles that are up to the task of protecting them from the dangers of fire,” Healy said.

Mark Tarbett, State Manager for the Country Fire Authority’s (CFA) Personal Protective Equipment and Clothing, welcomed the new facility and said that the technology will provide access to highly specialised services to assess the performance of firefighting materials and emerging protective garment designs. “This will ultimately lead to safer outcomes for people working in high-risk environments such as firefighters and other emergency service personnel,” Tarbett said.

RMIT’s partnerships with the CFA and other firefighting and military uniform makers will help to ensure high demand for the facility. The project has received funding from the Australian Research Council, the Defence Science and Technology Group, RMIT, Deakin and Swinburne universities, and garment manufacturing company Bruck Textiles.

Healy said that the facility underscores RMIT School of Fashion and Textiles’ responsiveness to industry needs. “We are really excited to now have this chamber operational at our Brunswick campus. It opens up so many exciting new opportunities for research, student learning and industry partnerships, and provides a solution the industry has been crying out for,” Healy said.","Called the Flash-Fire Laboratory for Advanced Manikin & Material Evaluation (FLAMME), the $2.3 million modular flame test chamber will be used by RMIT researchers and research students in partnership with industry.

188,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"WorkSafe Victoria has urged employers to address psychological hazards in their workplaces as the number of mental injuries in Victorian workplaces rises. WorkSafe Executive Director Health and Safety Narelle Beer called for employers to mark World Mental Health Day by making sure they had policies, processes and training in place to address risks such as bullying, aggression, trauma, fatigue, stress and high job demands. Of the 28,682 claims received by WorkSafe in the 2021–22 financial year, 4340 were for mental injuries. While claims for work-related mental injuries currently make up 15.1% of all new claims (up from 13.1% the previous year), they are on track to grow to a third of all WorkSafe claims by the end of the decade.

Beer said that mental injuries often needed more recovery time than physical injuries, meaning more time off and higher costs. “Sadly, while three-quarters of workers with a physical injury are back on the job in six months, just 40% of workers with mental injury return to work within that time. Just because a mental injury is harder to see, doesn’t mean it can’t be prevented. We’re putting employers on notice that they have a legal obligation to make sure their workplaces are psychologically safe,” Beer said.

Employers who fail to take reasonable steps to prevent mental injury could face prosecution under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, including potential fines of up to $332,000 for an individual or $1.66 million for a body corporate. “Our message to employers is clear, if you turn a blind eye to bullying, harassment, or other psychological health hazards then you’re risking your workers’ safety, lost productivity and potential hefty fines,” Beer said.

Throughout October, WorkSafe will use social media to remind employers of the need to address psychological health hazards at work. WorkSafe aims to provide support and guidance to Victorian employers to reduce workplace mental injury risks through its WorkWell program, which has engaged with more than 13,200 workplaces since 2017, through grants, learning networks and resources. The WorkWell Toolkit for Small Businesses, launched earlier this year, provides free tools and information such as case studies, policy templates, videos and tip sheets from organisations such as Beyond Blue and R U OK?.","WorkSafe Victoria has urged employers to address psychological hazards in their workplaces as the number of mental injuries in Victorian workplaces rises.

190,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"A paper published in the European Journal of Humour Research has explored the relationship between humour and workplace bullying and found that humour in the workplace, although typically linked to wellbeing and happiness, can also have a dark side. University of Auckland researcher Dr Barbara Plester said that she did not set out to study bullying when she and her co-authors, Business School doctoral candidate Emily Brewer and Professor Tim Bentley of Edith Cowan University, commenced a multi-year study of humour and organisational culture. However, their research within four New Zealand-based organisations, which involved worker observation, in-depth interviews, document collection, and ad hoc discussions with participants, revealed a culture around humour within one business that was not entirely funny. In the (now defunct) business, which had fewer than 30 employees, the researchers observed sexualised, dominating and hierarchical humour. However, all of the employees said they did not consider it to be bullying.

“I didn’t want to get into what I call the dark side of humour, but I found it, and our paper investigates the relationship between humour and bullying and suggests that this type of bullying can be even more insidious and difficult to address because the use of humour creates a smokescreen, which to some extent protects the perpetrator,” Plester said.

Plester said that it is difficult for employees to call out bullying when it’s packaged like a joke, as this distances them from those involved in the humour and defines them as ‘other’ within their organisational culture. “Although the interactions we looked at were unanimously identified as humour by all staff members, our interpretation and construction suggest that these joking social behaviours can be perceived as bullying,” Plester said.

Using the criteria for bullying as repeated, dominating, negative behaviour, the researchers attest that bullying in the organisation was perpetrated and disguised as rebellious behaviour. When left unchallenged, and in the hands of those skilled in performance and delivery, and without the option for the support of a human resources team, such humorous bullying can have devastating consequences and may cause embarrassment, confusion and harm, according to Plester. “In addressing this emerging insight into a form of bullying, we invite further explorations into the relationship between humour and bullying and reassert that sometimes ‘just joking’ may not be funny at all,” Plester said.","A paper published in the European Journal of Humour Research has explored the relationship between humour and workplace bullying and found that humour in the workplace, although typically linked to wellbeing and happiness, can also have a dark side.

191,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The McKell Institute of Victoria has released a report into the state’s apprenticeship system. The ‘Working, Learning: Better supporting Victorian apprentices on the job’ report found that bullying, harassment and unpaid wages were on the rise for apprentices, with few knowing where to turn to for help. According to the report, approximately two-thirds of Victorian apprentices were not aware of the Victorian Registration & Qualifications Authority’s (VRQA) roles and responsibilities, as the state’s apprenticeship regulator. The report calls for greater accountability for employers, better support for apprentices, and more regulation.

In response to the report, the Victorian Trades Hall Council has called for urgent action to ensure apprentices receive the instruction, support, respect and safety they need for their on-the-job training, particularly due to the growing demand for apprenticeships. There is currently no vetting system for employers to hire apprentices, little to no regulation of employers, and no system in place to identify or punish employers who mistreat their employees and/or commit wage theft. The report revealed that although apprenticeship numbers have increased recently, they fell significantly over the last decade, with apprenticeship completion rates also falling below the national average. The report reveals that, “Fewer than 20,000 Victorian apprentices completed their training in each of the years just prior to the pandemic,” while some occupations — most notably in the hospitality and food industries — experienced a “significant decline” in training rates over the last two decades.

Employer-related issues were a critical factor in apprenticeship completion, with the report from the McKell Institute indicating that “reported incidence of workplace issues, including bullying and harassment, and unpaid wages,” are on the rise. The need for support has also increased, with the report finding “3-times growth in the percentage of apprentices who need support to understand their contract obligations, and a 6-times increase in the percentage of employers who need the same”. Tellingly, the report found that the VRQA’s apprenticeship field services — that are currently outsourced — visited approximately 1.2% of all apprentices each year, which equates to three visits per working day by all of its authorised officers.

The report drew on the Victorian Young Workers Centre — a non-government organisation which sits within the Victorian Trades Hall Council and provides resources, training and support to help young people understand their rights at work — for additional data and found that in its 2019–20 Annual Report, it experienced an increase in the number of Victorian apprentices reaching out with employment issues. This increase also continued into 2020–21. The employment issues experienced by apprentices reaching out to the Victorian Young Workers Centre included, but were not limited to, bullying and harassment, unsafe workplaces, unpaid TAFE fees and wage theft. The Young Workers Centre also revealed that complaints from apprentices have now risen to one in two of their ongoing clients, with exploitation and abuse reported across all sectors — from hairdressing and hospitality to construction and beyond.

The report has urged the Victorian Government to consider that the policy measures being used by governments and industry to make apprenticeships more appealing must include action to fix the on-the-job experience of apprentices. “When an apprentice experiences onsite bullying and harassment, intimidation, or is subjected to dangerous conditions, they are less likely to finish their apprenticeship. When an apprentice is underpaid, or has unpaid TAFE fees or superannuation, they are less likely to finish their apprenticeship. When an apprentice receives little or no on-the-job training their engagement is as cheap labour rather than workers requiring skill development, they are less likely to finish their apprenticeship. Exploitation is not conducive to learning, and employers need to be held accountable when these issues exist in the workplace,” the report said.

Following the release of the report, the Young Workers Centre called on the Victorian Government to change how it regulates the apprenticeship system, with YWC activists campaigning, sharing their stories with the media, holding community meetings and running online actions. The Young Workers Centre has also called for safe environments for all apprentices, in the lead-up to the state election on 26 November.","According to the report, approximately two-thirds of Victorian apprentices were not aware of the Victorian Registration & Qualifications Authority’s (VRQA) roles and responsibilities, as the state’s apprenticeship regulator.

192,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Transport Workers Union has welcomed the NSW Labor Government’s commitment to introduce workers compensation entitlements and minimum rates and conditions for gig economy workers, if elected. The commitment would see protections that ensure owner drivers have minimum rates and conditions — including protections against unfair dismissals — are extended to gig workers, who currently fall outside the scope of legislation. It would also introduce a scheme for gig workers for workers compensation, akin to what NSW workers injured in workplaces currently receive.

Food delivery riders are currently denied basic entitlements like minimum rates of pay, sick and annual leave, superannuation and workers compensation. Without these rights, riders are under pressure to rush and work long hours, both to make a decent living and avoid being terminated from apps if they fail to meet unrealistic deadlines. The commitment comes as Uber settles workers compensation claims from the families of Dede Fredy and Bijoy Paul, who were among five food delivery workers killed while making deliveries in NSW in 2020.

NSW State Secretary Richard Olsen said Labor’s commitment to introduce workers compensation for all gig workers would be a relief for families who have had to fight for support through archaic legal processes. Olsen said that ensuring all workers have these entitlements would prevent more families from being forced to go through the same ordeal with no guarantee of outcome. “All workers deserve workers compensation regardless of how they’re labelled. The families of Dede Fredy and Bijoy Paul should not have had to prolong their trauma by having to fight for proper compensation in court because laws and protections haven’t kept pace with the gig economy,” Olsen said.

As part of its commitment, the Labor Government also intends to address the underlying pressures leading to the deaths of delivery riders.

“This is a proud moment for gig workers who have been fighting for years for minimum pay and conditions to ensure their safety at work. If adopted, it would mean gig workers receive fair rates of pay and the ability to dispute unfair dismissals, rather than being cruelly sacked by an algorithm without any appeals process if they’re not fast enough. This won’t just mean a fairer and more equitable system for gig workers — it will save lives on our roads. This commitment would finally bring NSW’s industrial relations system into the 21st century and ensure no transport worker falls through the cracks, forced to work under deadly pressure,” Olsen said.

The federal government recently acted on a united industry push for reform and announced its intention to empower the Fair Work Commission to set enforceable standards for all transport workers, including gig workers. Earlier this year, the Transport Workers Union signed charters with Uber and DoorDash, agreeing to a set of principles for food delivery and rideshare workers, including a regulatory body to set enforceable standards across the industry.","The Transport Workers Union has welcomed the NSW Labor Government’s commitment to introduce workers compensation entitlements and minimum rates and conditions for gig economy workers, if elected.

193,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Australian startup triiyo has partnered with the Department of Regional NSW to offer a customised, online platform for employees on parental leave. The program commenced in October 2022 and aims to provide an all-in-one tool for employees where they can access information, communicate with their colleagues, get paired with a buddy on their team and stay on track in their career — all at their own pace. Donna Mcleod, Director Workforce Capability and Talent at the Department of Regional NSW, said the Department partnered with triiyo because it wanted to ensure that its workers had support and a means of staying connected at a cadence that suits them.

“Being able to access information on the triiyo platform, regardless of gender, will help all parents on their journey,” Mcleod said.

Mcleod also stressed the importance of open communication between managers and their employees at every stage of parental leave — from finding out that they’re pregnant, to putting together a communications plan whilst they’re away, to career planning for when they return to work. “I think in the early days, it’s about creating a safe space for employees and managers to have an open conversation. Because in the early stages, there are a number of scans, blood works and doctor’s appointments that need to happen — and a number of women feel unwell through the first trimester. So, it’s about talking to employees and asking, ‘How can we support you? What can we put in place?’ And being really adaptive,” Mcleod said.

The triiyo platform offers a safe and confidential place for employees to access the information they need to prepare themselves for that first conversation and navigate the other stages of their parental leave journal with their manager when they’re ready. Companies can upload their policies and procedures and create community channels where employees can connect with their colleagues who are also on leave to share experiences and seek advice. Triiyo also provides access to a resource hub curated by experts to support employees through every stage of every life event — from miscarriage and infertility, to balancing work with parenthood, and everything in between.

Rebecca Grainer, founder of triiyo, said the platform was designed to exist outside of company HR systems, so employees can access a safe and confidential space that ensures people get support early on in what many employees fear are career-limiting phases. Employees who opt in receive guidance and reminders with what they need to do and what they need to think about at each stage. All of the journeys are aligned to company policy and best practice, and delivered in real time — according to each individual’s personal timeline.

“triiyo is going to be great for us, because at firm or agency level, there’ll be a lot of things happening. Our secretary has recently retired, and that’s a good example — those who are on parental leave, unless they check their email or read the news regularly, probably wouldn’t see that. So, we’ll have a company page on triiyo where employees can see major changes happening at the agency without having to get into the details — headlines only. If they want to know more, they can connect with their colleagues, or they can communicate with their boss and ask any questions,” Mcleod said.

Mcleod said that return to work is also a key focus, adding that when employees integrate back into the workplace, triiyo aims to help them and their managers to have transparent conversations about the hours they’re going to be available, about where they’re going to do the work and about the role that they were doing before they went on parental leave to make sure that it is adjusted, if necessary. 83% of the workforce for the Department of Regional NSW is reportedly located in the regions; having employees in remote areas means that it is critical that they build a sense of care and community around them — especially when they’re on parental leave. “I think by not having a keeping-in-touch platform or not keeping in touch with parents on leave, you’re running a very real risk that these people might not engage at the end of their leave,” Mcleod said.

NSW public sector employees can now access up to 14 weeks of paid parental leave — regardless of gender. “By partnering with triiyo, organisations are showing that they care about their people. Plus, it supports diversity and inclusion initiatives with actionable and tailored advice not just for employees, but also for the managers providing support,” Grainger said.

Mcleod said that triiyo gives employees access to drive how they want to communicate with their managers and gives them a peer network with other parents and carers for when they come back to work. “They can share some of those challenges about how they’re settling in or if they’re struggling — if their baby is getting sick often in day care. And they’ll have somebody who can say, ‘Hey, that’s okay, that’s completely normal. I’ve been there.’ Or, ‘That’s all right, try this.’ So, we think it really gives a good end-to-end support,” Mcleod said.

194,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The COVID-19 pandemic generated several challenges for Australian dentists, but it also engendered some positive outcomes. Australian dentists reported their challenging experiences to be four-fold including “public health orders and restrictions”, “infection prevention and control measures (IPC)”, “personal concerns about COVID-19” and “detracting opinions about COVID-19”. Conversely, they reported positive outcomes in relation to their practice during COVID-19, including “awareness of and adherence to IPC practices”, “teamwork and interpersonal dynamics” and “decompressed workload”[1].

Like other frontline healthcare workers, a major challenge faced by dentists was having to adjust their services and workflows to ensure patient safety and minimise risk of transmission. Studies have reported anxiety amongst dentists regarding the risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2 and passing the infection to household members. Public health orders restricting gathering and movement, changes to routine practice and cancellation of non-urgent dental care appointments generated significant challenges and concerns amongst dentists about patient care and their financial security.

The lockdowns resulted in long waiting lists and postponed treatments for patients in need of care. Cancellations and alterations of appointments further disrupted routine patient management, resulting in increased workload when the restrictions were eased to have contributed to increased risk of burnout and psychological distress.

195,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Food delivery riders generally don’t take more risks on the roads — despite the huge time pressures of the gig economy and hungry customers — according to a recent study carried out by the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) that observed and compared 3401 bicycle food delivery riders and private cyclists in Brisbane. The study by QUT’s Centre for Accident Research & Road Safety was published in the November edition of the Accident Analysis & Prevention journal.

Researchers Dr Oscar Oviedo-Trespalacios, Dr Elisabeth Rubie and Professor Narelle Haworth AM looked at red light running, helmet wearing and mobile phone use. Their team of 13 researchers analysed sites across five inner Brisbane suburbs (South Brisbane, West End, Newstead, New Farm and Central Brisbane) during lunchtime and dinnertime peaks over six days last winter. The researchers found that despite media and public concern, the observations did not support a view that bicycle food delivery riders (BFDRs) engage in more risky riding behaviours than private riders. Overall, helmets were worn by 94.7% of riders (BFDRs 99.3% vs private riders 93.4%), which is positive given the safety benefits that helmets offer in the event of a crash or fall.

First author Dr Oviedo-Trespalacios said that although the research team witnessed some risky behaviours by private cyclists and bicycle food delivery riders (BFDRs), overall, neither group was worse than the other. “There has been enormous growth in the gig economy and the home delivery of meals — which was particularly accelerated during the COVID-19 lockdowns, not just in Australia, but around the world,” Oviedo-Trespalacios said.

The study revealed that while there is increasing evidence that food delivery on pushbikes or electric bikes is an occupation with significant road safety risks — as the pressure to get food delivered fast can encourage risky behaviour — BFDRs are not more likely to run a red light, not wear a helmet or ignore other road rules.

“This doesn’t mean it’s all good news though. We witnessed plenty of risky behaviour among the 2274 BFDRs and 1127 private cyclists who we observed in the inner suburbs of Brisbane during the day and night,” Oviedo-Trespalacios said. Overall, 24% of all riders confronted with a red traffic or pedestrian light did not stop; whether the rider was a BFDR or a private rider had little direct influence on red light running. Instead, tiding the wrong way in the traffic lane and swapping between the footpath and the road were more common among those who disobeyed signals. Long waiting times for the walk signal and bicycles not triggering traffic signals were also likely to encourage riders to cross on red, particularly under time pressure.

The study found that helmet wearing was better among delivery riders, as 99.8% of BFDRs wore a helmet, versus 93.4% of private cyclists. Men were slightly more likely to wear a helmet than women. Most riders avoided handheld phone use while riding, but cradles with mobile phones were very prevalent among BFDRs. “It was very difficult for our observers to see if riders were touching their phones while moving, but when they did witness it, it was more likely to be food delivery riders physically interacting with their phones than private riders,” Oviedo-Trespalacios said.

The authors also found slight behavioural differences between delivery riders who were employees paid per hour and those who were contractors paid per job. In particular, contractors were more likely to have a phone visible than employed riders. The findings suggest that organisations that employ BFDRs manage rider distraction better than companies that contract riders. The study also found that at least six food delivery riders died in road crashes in Australia in 2020.

A New South Wales Food Delivery Safety Taskforce established after the deaths identified more than 80 serious incidents involving delivery riders over 2019 and 2020. The taskforce’s conclusions noted that between 4 pm and 8 pm was the worst danger time, and contributing factors to incidents included fatigue and time and emotional pressures.","The researchers found that despite media and public concern, the observations did not support a view that bicycle food delivery riders (BFDRs) engage in more risky riding behaviours than private riders.

196,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"Workers installing solar panels on rooftops will be visited by inspectors from SafeWork NSW, who are undertaking a six-month state-wide operation to ensure safety in the industry. SafeWork NSW Executive Director (Compliance & Dispute Resolution) Matthew Press said this is the second time SafeWork inspectors have targeted this activity with inspectors visiting 286 solar panel installation sites in 2021, uncovering some alarming unsafe practices. Press said that the installation of solar photovoltaic systems has increased over recent years, partly due to government rebates, with NSW having installed most new rooftop solar panels in Australia in 2021.

“Solar retailers and installers have responsibilities under work health and safety laws to ensure workers are not at risk of falls from heights or contact with electricity, the two biggest safety risks the industry faces. Falls from heights is the biggest cause of traumatic fatalities on NSW construction sites, with most serious or fatal falls being from roofs, ladders or unsafe scaffolds — and from a height of four metres or less. That’s about the height of a single-storey house,” Press said.

The safest protection against falls from heights when working on a roof is to use roof rails or scaffolding. Solar rooftop installers must only use harnesses as a last resort, when roof rails cannot be installed. According to Press, of the 186 inspections carried out last year, 69% of sites were only using harnesses or did not have fall protection at all. Of the sites using harnesses, 32% did not have appropriate anchor points in place and 50% were not clipped on to anything. A further 26% of sites did not have their ladder fixed at the top nor did the ladder extend one metre past the landing space. The inspections also found that 27% of sites did not place a lock on the main electrical switch or the meter box and 14% did not adequately address the risk of overhead powerlines. An inspector also observed a solar panel installation in progress with a worker at risk of falls of approximately 3.4 metres from a residential home, as the harness system in use was not connected properly. It was also found that the means of access to the roof was not acceptable due to the ladder being unsecured.

“The risks are real. In January 2020, an apprentice electrician fractured his pelvis and back after falling more than three metres from a roof while installing solar panels at a construction site in Parklea. Later that year during another solar install, a 27-year-old roofing contractor fell more than three metres through the roof of a shearing shed, fracturing his back, at a rural property in Alectown near Parkes. That is why SafeWork will have their boots on the ground, working with retailers and installers from now until the end of the year to ensure rooftop solar installers safety,” Press said.

As part of the most recent inspection, fines will be issued for non-compliance, with a zero-tolerance approach taken to falls risks. SafeWork NSW has $1000 rebates available for safety purchases which could prevent an incident. A Guide to Solar Panel Safety and accompanying installers’ checklist is also available to help control the risks.

197,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"The Western Australian Government has responded to the parliamentary inquiry into the fly-in, fly-out mining industry with a range of actions to tackle sexual assault and sexual harassment in the state’s workplaces. Tabled in parliament on 21 September 2022, the McGowan government’s response to the parliamentary inquiry has supported, or supported in principle, all recommendations pertaining to the state government. The plans will be implemented across key areas such as primary prevention, data and research, a refocused regulatory framework and better support and advocacy for victims of workplace sexual harassment.

As part of the state government’s response, a new code of practice will be developed to help improve security measures for workers staying at workplace accommodation. The code will act as a minimum standard hat employers must consider to ensure the safety of their workers living regionally or remotely. The state government has also committed to funding a community legal and advocacy service centre to provide free guidance, information and referrals to affected Western Australians.

Mines and Petroleum and Industrial Relations Minister Bill Johnston said that the state government is committed to providing safe and inclusive workplaces for all employees across Western Australia, regardless of the industry or size, and called on the industry to ensure that the mining sector is accountable and responsive to community standards. “I want to acknowledge the bravery and resilience of the women who shared their stories with the parliamentary inquiry. We need to work together to build a culture of respect as women have a right to work in safe workplaces that are free from sexual harassment. We cannot be complacent when it comes to inappropriate workplace behaviours; there is much to be done and the McGowan government will continue to advocate for change,” Johnston said.

The state government also recognised the importance of providing victims of workplace sexual harassment with the opportunity to share their experiences, receive psychological support and promote healing. In line with Recommendation 20, the state government has committed to changing the law to bring WA’s definition of what constitutes sexual harassment in line with other Australian jurisdictions and to remove the ‘disadvantage test’ complainants. The government plans to introduce these legislative reforms early next year.

The state government also supports the recommendation to establish a fully resourced, culturally appropriate expert group within WorkSafe WA to investigate, assess and deal with reports of sexual harassment and assault offences in the sector. These initiatives build on a number of existing programs that the state government has been progressing, including the $8.4 million Mental Awareness, Respect and Safety (MARS) program that boosts responses to mental health, workplace culture and mine safety in WA’s mining sector. The MARS program oversees a number of projects including the Respect in Mining pilot program, the Thrive at Work in Mining program and a study into mental health, workplace culture and safety across Western Australia’s mining sector.

Women’s Interest Minister Simone McGurk said that it is imperative that the mining sector works with the state government to lead cultural change and prioritise prevention and better support for victim survivors.

“The McGowan government is committed to stamping out sexual violence in the workplace — everyone has a right to feel safe and supported at work. We have a vicious cycle, where women aren’t attracted to work in the industry, let alone stay in the industry, because of inappropriate behaviour and a disregard of women’s experiences. We need more women to work in this sector and we need them to be treated with respect. I would especially like to thank the women who spoke to the inquiry about their experiences — your courage will help make the industry safer for future generations,” McGurk said.

The state government is building on its commitment to ensuring safe workplaces for all WA employees across all industries, including through implementing the Respect@Work report recommendations and developing Western Australia’s whole-of-government Sexual Violence Prevention Strategy. The government’s response to the parliamentary inquiry can be found here.","The plans will be implemented across key areas such as primary prevention, data and research, a refocused regulatory framework and better support and advocacy for victims of workplace sexual harassment.

198,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"GETTING SUN SAFETY ON TO YOUR WORKPLACE WHS AGENDA: TIPS, TRICKS AND HACKS

Working outdoors has many benefits, but did you know that your outdoor workers can receive up to 10 times more exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) compared to indoor workers? This places them at greater risk of skin cancer, Australia’s national cancer. UVR is a grade 1 carcinogen in the same category as asbestos and businesses have an obligation to implement control measures every day to prevent harm to their workers.

Research shows that in Australia, while 50% of employees are using some form of sun protection while at work, only 10% are fully protected from the sun.

While Cancer Council and regulatory peak bodies provide information and advice to support businesses implement sun protection in their workplace, it can be challenging to engage businesses in a comprehensive approach that extends beyond one-off sun safety education sessions aimed at their workers.

During this webinar we’ll discuss the ‘what’ the ‘why’ and importantly the practical ‘how to’ of outdoor workplace sun safety strategies. While we know the evidence, we would love to hear your perspective on putting sun safety into practice.

199,NSCA Foundation,Asset Media,"WORKPLACE SAFETY INDUSTRY BENCHMARKING AND THE DUE DILIGENCE INDEX

Current approaches to reporting on safety performance based on lost time and injury frequency rates do not provide reliable data on the state of safety. Frequency rate data tells us nothing about the state of safety, has no predictive value in relation to future incidents, and has been shown to be prone to manipulation.

An alternative approach that actively assesses the state of safety whilst also being both objectively measurable and comparable across organisations is required.

The webinar will explore how the Due Diligence Index – Safety (DDI-S) has been developed to provide a metric to understand the presence of safety by collecting and reporting on the state of assurance activity being taken at the organisational level. We’ll discuss:

People as the solution, not the problem;

Safety as the presence of positives, not the absence of negatives; and

Safety as an ethical responsibility rather than a bureaucratic activity

Who should attend?

This webinar will be of interest to health and safety leaders looking to build the health and safety capacity and resilience of their organisation, founded on engagement and trust with workers.
