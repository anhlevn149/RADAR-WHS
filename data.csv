An estimated 4,000 Australians die annually from asbestos-related diseases.

Asbestos has been completely banned in Australia since December 2003.

While two decades have passed since the ban, a significant amount of ageing asbestos-containing material remains in our built environment, which means there is an ongoing need for vigilance to prevent exposure to asbestos fibres and a need to focus on safe, proactive removal.
